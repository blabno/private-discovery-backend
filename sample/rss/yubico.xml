            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security has been moving to the forefront of government regulations — and rightfully so. From DFARS to FIPS, PSD2, GDPR, and eIDAS, nations and service providers are being forced to address user security and privacy with a more mindful approach. For years, Yubico has helped organizations like </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/gov-uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOV.UK</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deliver secure authentication options and </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-compliance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meet regulatory compliance requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and today, we’re seeing this work expand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Europen countries are now in the process of deploying modern web authentication, including YubiKeys, for their citizens. This comes in large part due Yubico’s recent work around the </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/eidas-regulation-regulation-eu-ndeg9102014"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eIDAS regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services), which was introduced by the EU Commission in 2014 to provide a predictable regulatory environment for secure and seamless electronic interactions in the European Single Market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the past five years, the eIDAS regulation has been widely adopted by the EU member states, and several eIDAS-compliant services and schemes have been rolled out across the European continent. However, what continues to trouble eIDAS Qualified Trust Service Providers is how to ensure that users are securely authenticated to their service, so that they get sole control over the remote signature creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to address this challenge, Yubico has designed a solution whereby FIDO2 can be used to secure access to a remote signing service and give users sole control over the signature creation process. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_529027" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-529027" class="wp-image-529027 size-full" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/blog-diagram-eu-eidas-r1-1.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="223" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/blog-diagram-eu-eidas-r1-1.jpg 510w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/blog-diagram-eu-eidas-r1-1-444x194.jpg 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/blog-diagram-eu-eidas-r1-1-450x197.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-529027" class="wp-caption-text">Using a YubiKey, FIDO authentication is used for unlocking the signing key and certificate at the service provider.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to securing remote signing solutions, the YubiKey can also be used for national electronic ID-card projects and eIDAS-compliant eID schemes, such as the </span><a href="https://www.talgildu.fo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Digitalisation Programme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Faroe Islands. Digital identity is one of four major pillars in the new digital infrastructure and will be launched in 2020.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico is partnering with </span><a href="https://www.nexusgroup.com/nexus-smart-id-empowers-digital-faroe-islands-vision-to-embrace-e-governance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deliver the eID solution, which will enable all Faroese citizens, above the age of 15, to securely and easily access government and banking services with a YubiKey 5 Series device. The resulting eID scheme will be classified as eIDAS assurance level ‘high’, which allows it to be recognized across all European online services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the reasons we chose Yubico’s YubiKey, is the fact that it is supported on almost all major mobile and desktop platforms and embraced by top internet players, including browser suppliers. In the near term, we see it as an added benefit to our citizens to offer an eID while at the same time offering an easy way to secure their online presence,“ said Janus Læarsson, Chief IT Architect, Talgildu Føroya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next generation of the National Digitalisation Programme at the Faroe Islands will support  FIDO2, the emerging open standard for web authentication, which will allow the YubiKey to be accredited as an eID card. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico is very active in projects, standardization and cutting-edge technology that are related to eIDAS and national eID projects in Europe. </span><a href="https://pages.yubico.com/email_subscription.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for our newsletter to stay tuned for more exciting news announced during 2020.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico was founded with the mission of making simple and secure logins ubiquitous. In 2008, we launched the first YubiKey for seamless, one-touch authentication. In 2012, in close collaboration with Google, Yubico’s inventions evolved into the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) open authentication standard, and in 2014 it was launched in Gmail and Chrome. In collaboration with Microsoft and the FIDO Alliance, the standard evolved into FIDO2, with the W3C web standards body certifying the standard under the name WebAuthn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With each </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/yubico-innovation-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passing year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Google, Opera, Mozilla, Microsoft, and Brave browsers have added support. Now, with Apple adding native support for FIDO and WebAuthn in iOS and iPadOS 13.3, these standards are supported by all leading platforms and browsers. Today, developers can make easy-to-use, privacy-preserving, strong authentication available to all users across all leading platforms and devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the highlights of native WebAuthn and FIDO support on iOS:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; line-height: 28.9px;">iOS and iPadOS 13.3+ natively support FIDO-compliant security keys, like the YubiKey, using the WebAuthn standard over near-field communication (NFC), USB, and/or Lightning as appropriate to the Apple hardware being used.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; line-height: 28.9px;">Currently, the WebAuthn second-factor use case (the FIDO U2F user experience) is the only log in flow that is supported. Security key-based biometrics or PIN (without the use of username and password) are not supported yet.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400; line-height: 28.9px;">Web apps via Safari, or mobile apps calling SFSafariViewController ASWebAuthenticationSession should work. If a service fails to work, it is likely that the provider is unaware that native support is now available on iOS, and needs to update their web flow. Please contact your service provider to make support.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With today’s announcement, Yubico now offers two great user experiences on iOS using a simple tap or a physical connection. Authentication via NFC is supported by the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-nfc">YubiKey 5 NFC</a> or <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-nfc-by-yubico">Security Key NFC</a> by Yubico by just tapping the YubiKey at the top of an iPhone (7 and above). Authentication via physical connection is supported by the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5ci">YubiKey 5Ci</a> by plugging the YubiKey into the Lightning or USB-C port of an iPhone or iPad.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">do? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers and online services can learn how to rapidly add support, including how to enable native support on iOS. If you are a developer, sign up to join the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Developer Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be informed on the latest reference documentation, testing tools, and open source servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals and companies who want easy, secure access to their daily online accounts — including those in financial, healthcare, and government services — can accelerate adoption by </span><a href="https://ctt.ac/BAehb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requesting support for YubiKey and WebAuthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Yubico is humbled by the many contributions our entire community has made, and would like to extend our utmost gratitude to every one of you that helped bring us one step closer to internet security ubiquity! </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that you can use a YubiKey to protect your online accounts even if a service doesn’t offer built-in support for security keys? That’s right. With the Yubico Authenticator app, individuals can use a YubiKey to secure any service or application as long as it supports other authentication apps as a two-factor authentication (2FA) option. These include Authy, Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, Yubico Authenticator has been available for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android platforms, but not iOS. This changed in October when Yubico released the first Yubico Authenticator for iOS with Lightning support. And today, we’re happy to announce that </span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yubico-authenticator/id1476679808"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the iOS app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has support for near-field communication (NFC) as well, thanks to </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/09/yubico-ios-authentication-expands-to-include-nfc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s recent NFC updates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With today’s news, the Yubico Authenticator app series now works seamlessly across all major desktop and mobile platforms, with full support for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s the difference between using Yubico Authenticator or another authentication app? Instead of storing the time-based one-time passcodes on a mobile phone or computer, Yubico Authenticator generates and stores one-time codes on the YubiKey. A user must present their physical key in order to receive the code for login. This not only eliminates security vulnerabilities associated with a multi-purpose computing device, but also offers an added layer of convenience for users that work between various machines. Yubico Authenticator provides a good balance of usability, security and portability. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, at </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Ignite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Yubico is excited to preview the long-awaited YubiKey Bio. It is the first YubiKey that will support fingerprint recognition for secure and seamless passwordless logins, which has been a top requested feature from many of our YubiKey users. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_526471" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-526471" class="size-medium wp-image-526471" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/biokey-3-keychain-444x296.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="296" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/biokey-3-keychain-444x296.jpg 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/biokey-3-keychain-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/biokey-3-keychain-1030x687.jpg 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/biokey-3-keychain-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/biokey-3-keychain-705x470.jpg 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/biokey-3-keychain-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /><p id="caption-attachment-526471" class="wp-caption-text">YubiKey Bio preview device.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey Bio delivers the convenience of biometric login with the added benefits of Yubico’s hallmark security, reliability and durability assurances. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biometric fingerprint credentials are stored in the secure element that helps protect them against physical attacks. The result? A single, trusted hardware-backed root of trust delivering a seamless login experience across different devices, operating systems, and applications. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With support for both biometric- and PIN-based login, the YubiKey Bio </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">leverages the full range of multi-factor authentication (MFA) capabilities outlined in the </span><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> standard specifications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignite attendees can see a live demo of passwordless sign-in to Microsoft Azure Active Directory accounts using the YubiKey Bio during Alex Simons&#8217; keynote on Tuesday, November 5.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L2y3g_094TI" width="780" height="424" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In keeping with Yubico’s design philosophy, the YubiKey Bio will not require any batteries, drivers, or associated software. The key seamlessly integrates with the native biometric enrollment and management features supported in the latest versions of Windows 10 and Azure Active Directory, making it quick and convenient for users to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopt a phishing-resistant passwordless login flow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a result of close collaboration between our engineering teams, Yubico is bringing strong hardware-backed biometric authentication to market to provide a seamless experience for our customers,” said Joy Chik, Corporate VP of Identity, Microsoft. “This new innovation will help drive adoption of safer passwordless sign-in so everyone can be more secure and productive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, Yubico has worked with Microsoft to help drive the future of passwordless authentication through the creation of the FIDO2 and WebAuthn open authentication standards. During this time, we’ve built YubiKey integrations with the full suite of FIDO2-enabled Microsoft products including Windows 10 with </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/azure-active-directory/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azure Active Directory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Microsoft Edge with</span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/microsoft-accounts/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Microsoft Accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we continue on this journey together with </span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/Expanding-Azure-Active-Directory-support-for-FIDO2-preview-to/ba-p/981894"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft’s announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to extend support for FIDO2 security keys, like the YubiKey, to hybrid Active Directory environments. Early next year, enterprise users will be able to authenticate to on-premises Active Directory integrated applications and resources, in addition to providing seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) to cloud- and SAML-based applications.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As National Cybersecurity Awareness Month comes to an end, our focus turns to what the developer community can do to stay cyber smart all year long. We’ve already talked about </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/10/national-cybersecurity-awareness-month-shining-a-spotlight-on-secure-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and shared tips on </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/10/staying-safe-online-beyond-national-cybersecurity-awareness-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to protect your personal accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, we offer tips from the Yubico Developer Team to developers looking to up their security game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to get started is by securing yourself, then help others. Get a password manager and enable strong two-factor or multi-factor authentication across all your personal and work accounts (read last week’s blog for </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/10/staying-safe-online-beyond-national-cybersecurity-awareness-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 Steps from Yubico to Protect Your Personal Accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s get into some more technical things you can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Secure your operating and development environments with encryption. You can do this with tools like EgoSecure Data Protection FDE, which provides easy and effective protection for your laptop. The encryption and decryption of data is completely transparent to authorized and authenticated users, which makes the solution simple to use. To enhance security, EgoSecure’s full disk encryption application supports two-factor authentication during pre-boot authentication using the YubiKey.<br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://egosecure.com/index-start.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-351289" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/egosecure_172x49.png" alt="" width="172" height="49" /></a><br />
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe hardware-backed multi-factor authentication plays a very important role in cybersecurity because it protects privacy without compromising ease of use.”</span><strong><em>– Sergej Schlotthauer, Vice President of Security Strategic Alliances, Egosecure (Egosecure is a Matrix42 company</em></strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Keep your code signing certificates and data safe by using <a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/#protocol=all&amp;usecase=developer-tools&amp;key=all">developer tools</a> that support multi-factor authentication. You can even sign code with the YubiKey by <a href="https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006474-code-signing-with-the-yubikey-on-windows">securely storing your code signing certificate on the YubiKey</a> itself. We talk a lot about FIDO, but the YubiKey also supports <a href="https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006420-using-your-yubikey-with-openpgp">OpenPGP</a>. Our latest firmware update included a number of enhancements to the OpenPGP implementation including ECC support, attestation, and multiple operations per touch. <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/08/whats-new-in-yubikey-firmware-5-2-3/">Read about it here</a>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Extend your security discipline to all of your devices, not just those that touch your corporate network. Attacks are often successful because of a weak point made available through a personal account.<br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cotech.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-351289" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CoTech_172x49.png" alt="" width="172" height="49" /></a><br />
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the rise of bring-your-own-device programs and remote work, the attack surface has shifted from corporate networks to endpoints. Thus, a modern security strategy must consider all endpoints, including mobile devices”</span><strong><em>– Dr. Dominik Schürmann, CEO, Cotech</em></strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Here’s a hot tip if you’re building YubiKey support into your product</strong>.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cotech provides ready-to-use animations to assist end-users on how to use security keys, and shows the smartphone-specific sweet-spot where NFC works best. With the Hardware Security SDK, Android developers enable strong, hardware-backed YubiKey security leveraging modern authentication protocols, such as Universal 2nd Factor (U2F).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Strong authentication doesn’t have to be hard to implement for yourself or your users. Be sure to leverage modern protocols such as FIDO2 or WebAuthn along with a YubiKey. We are constantly impressed by the different use cases brought to us by companies from all over the world. Take for instance, Gandi. Because a domain name is used for websites, email addresses, SSL certificates, and more, they are valuable assets for individuals, organizations, and businesses. Gandi offers two-factor authentication with the YubiKey to make sure only authorized users can access an account.<br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gandi.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-351289" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gandi_172x49.png" alt="" width="172" height="49" /></a><br />
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether they&#8217;re working for profit, the common good, or fun, our customers&#8217; projects are tied to their domains. Our job as service providers is to keep them safe. Staying on the cutting edge of security technology is essential to that mission.”</span><strong><em>– Andrew Richner, Head of Communication, Gandi US</em></strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re also serious about integrating security into the products, services, and applications that you’re building, check out </span><a href="https://developers.yubico.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico’s Developer website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, we talked about </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/10/national-cybersecurity-awareness-month-shining-a-spotlight-on-secure-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its role in securing businesses from cyber threats as part of our </span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign. Today, we will take you through what’s putting your personal accounts at risk, and share tips from our partners on how to stay better protected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start by identifying some of the biggest threats to personal accounts —  phishing, SIM swapping, and database leaks. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Phishing</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using fake websites and emails that look genuine, attackers lure you into providing your login credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), and other private data, such as banking and credit card numbers. This is called <a href="https://www.yubico.com/phishing/">phishing</a>. These stolen credentials are used to take over your account. From there, an attacker can lock you out and even compromise your other accounts through password reset flows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, 51% of respondents in our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ponemon-Authentication-Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 State of Password and Authentication Security Behaviors Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said they have experienced a phishing attack on their personal accounts, while 44% experienced one at work.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>SIM Swapping</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SIM swap attacks are becoming increasingly more common, particularly for individuals with a lot to lose financially. In these scenarios, the attacker poses as the account holder (usually through various pieces of PII they’ve gathered elsewhere) and convinces your mobile service provider that you are switching from your current phone to another phone. Once complete, the attacker can intercept one-time passcodes (OTP) sent to your mobile phone number now associated with the phone in their possession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once this is achieved, the attacker can essentially perform password resets on any of your accounts that leverage text-based (SMS) 2FA. In most cases, if you’re using the same email address for all your accounts, then the attacker really only needs access to your email account after the SIM swap. Here’s a real-life example that </span><a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-most-expensive-lesson-of-my-life-details-of-sim-port-hack-35de11517124"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost one individual $100,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Database Leaks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A database leak occurs when a service provider is breached and the attacker accesses the database of stored user credentials. The information from those databases often end up on the black market for other attackers to use. There are countless examples of database leaks we could reference (hackers </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/yahoo-hack.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stole</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one billion Yahoo! login credentials in 2016, the Equifax breach affecting </span><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2017/09/equifax-data-breach-what-do"><span style="font-weight: 400;">143 million American consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017). There’s really nothing you can do as the account holder to ensure the service provider is properly storing your password. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve probably been told that the longer and more complex you make your password, the stronger it will be. Sure, long passwords with numbers and symbols are hard to guess, but even the most complex and unique passwords won’t stop attackers when they’ve stolen the account password itself from a poorly protected database. That’s why it’s a good idea to use a different password for each and every account you have. Doing so </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">limit your risk and exposure in the event a password database of a service you use is breached.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Our Advice</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to feel defeated or helpless against these attacks, and you can still protect your accounts by simply enabling strong </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/what-is-two-factor-authentication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two-factor authentication (2FA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the services you use. There are multiple types of 2FA and MFA — avoid SMS (</span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/what-is-two-factor-authentication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we explain why here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). We believe hardware is not only easy to use, but also stronger given that these attacks are all remote-based. Using hardware security keys, like YubiKeys, require physical possession. Since you’re here reading our blog, we recommend you check out </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the YubiKey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and explore all the services that </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work with YubiKeys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us have friends or family members in need of basic account security advice. The trick is figuring out how to help without losing them in the details as you watch their eyes glaze over with boredom or confusion. Below, you’ll find 10 steps that any person can take to protect their personal accounts from the attacks we talked about today. If you feel your personal threat model isn’t addressed by this blog, hang tight! More tips are coming!</span></p>
<h3><strong>10 Steps from Yubico to Protect Your Personal Accounts </strong></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the years, we’ve developed software and hardware 2FA solutions to better protect users online. We’ve been fortunate enough to forge partnerships with global leaders in password management, browsers and platforms, cloud services, and many more, as part of our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Works with YubiKey Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“2FA, plus a password manager, is the best way to protect your data. If someone were to learn your password for an account, they’d need that second factor to access it, making account takeover much less likely.”</span></em><em> </em><strong><i>&#8211;</i></strong><i> </i><strong>Jeff Shiner, CEO, 1Password </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dashlane_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sensitive accounts like banking, email, and social media warrant an additional layer of protection. Having strong, unique passwords for every account is a necessary first step in securing our digital lives.”</span></em><em> </em><strong><i>&#8211;</i></strong><i> </i><strong>Emmanuel Schalit, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Dashlane</strong></p>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cryptocurrency is built on the fundamental promises of security and freedom. To deliver on these promises, people need to be in control of their security, and have the opportunity to choose the measures that suit their needs.”</span></em><strong><i> &#8211; </i>Mike Rymanov, CEO, DSX</strong></p>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t give attackers a single target. Use a different password everywhere, a different email address or alias with subscriptions, and protect your accounts with a hardware authenticator. Your other accounts won’t be at risk in the event one account is compromised.”</span></em><strong><i> &#8211; </i>Ricardo Signes, CTO, Fastmail</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://keepersecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Keeper_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s a great time to get cyber-checked. With data breaches becoming more frequent, one of the most basic precautions is to use strong, unique passwords for every account along with 2FA. That is the first step towards protecting yourself against account takeover.&#8221;</span></em> <strong>&#8211; Craig Lurey, CTO, Keeper</strong><br />

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Yubico Login for Windows application (formerly Windows Logon Tool) is now generally available, providing a simple and secure way for YubiKey users to securely access their local accounts on Windows computers. Over the past six months, we’ve received valuable feedback from many of our public preview users, and have a clear path forward for ongoing improvements to the application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary benefits of Yubico Login for Windows include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly secure and easy-to-use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for login using local accounts to Windows workstations </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple configuration for up to 10 individual users </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast enrollment for backup YubiKeys</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy recovery mechanisms for lost YubiKeys</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Login for Windows is designed to provide strong MFA for logging into local accounts on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 computers. It is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suited for logging into any of the following accounts: Azure Active Directory (AAD), Active Directory (AD), Microsoft accounts (e.g. username@outlook.com, username@hotmail.com, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">username@</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">live.com</span>).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Yubico Login for Windows is now only applicable for securing local accounts, there are other solutions to secure AD and AAD accounts with MFA. Thanks to an ongoing partnership and collaboration between Yubico and Microsoft, YubiKey MFA is also an option for organizations with AAD or AD environments. For computers joined to cloud-based AAD, passwordless authentication with the YubiKey is currently </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/azure-active-directory/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported in Azure AD preview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For accounts managed by AD, the YubiKey enables authentication as a </span><a href="https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000006456-yubikey-smart-card-deployment-guide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PIV-compliant smart card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Windows 7+, Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2+). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information on the Windows login options available with the YubiKey, and to download the current version of Yubico Login for Windows, please visit our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/computer-logon-tools/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">computer login tools page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multi-protocol YubiKey 5 Series or YubiKey 4 Series keys are required for compatibility with Yubico Login for Windows.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">October is <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/national-cyber-security-awareness-month" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Cybersecurity Awareness Month (NCSAM)</a>, and here at Yubico, we’re doing our part to raise awareness on the importance of cybersecurity and staying safe online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billions of login credentials and user records are routinely leaked — sometimes in the course of a single year — and can cause significant damage to those who fall victim. By enforcing two-factor (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA), you make it harder for hackers to crack the account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend investing in access management platforms, such as Identity Access Management (IAM) and <a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/privileged-users/">Privileged Access Management (PAM),</a> which enable you to proactively take steps to enhance cybersecurity for your users. In recent years, leaders in IAM and PAM have innovated to deliver high security, without compromising ease of use, to address the challenges of an increasingly online workforce. In doing so, these services implemented support for stronger, more modern forms of user authentication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In honor of NCSAM, we’ve asked some of our IAM and PAM partners to provide tips for enterprises looking to tackle these challenges. </span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Yves Audebert, President and Co-CEO, Axiad IDS</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Validating identities and ensuring trust across every entity that interacts with the enterprise network is vital to business operations. IT leaders will need an agile identity platform that balances risks, compliance, and user experience.”</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.boxcryptor.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/boxcryptor_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Robert Freudenreich, CTO, Boxcryptor</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a time when data is the new instrument of power, citizens need to start defending themselves against the excessive collection of data. Protecting your cloud with zero knowledge encryption is a good starting point.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.digicert.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/digicert_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mike Nelson, VP of IoT Security, DigiCert</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With our growing list of connected devices, protecting consumer privacy starts with implementing security fundamentals to ensure that data is encrypted, devices only trust properly authenticated connections, and that code running on each device is secure.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/security-key/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Google_Cloud_logo_172x49-1.png" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sam Srinivas, Director of Product Management, Google Cloud</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Other security controls are virtually irrelevant if an attacker can get through the front door by phishing your credentials. Google was an early adopter of FIDO security keys to provide a defense against the dangers of targeted phishing attacks.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.identityautomation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/identityautomation_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>James Litton, CEO and Co-Founder, Identity Automation</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;IAM does more than just help IT staff create user accounts; it enables productivity and provides a solid security foundation by addressing authentication and rights management. IAM must be the core of your security program to effectively secure your </span>data and systems.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.intercede.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/intercede_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Allen Storey, Chief Product Officer, Intercede</strong></span></p>
<p><em>“Cyberattacks affect enterprises and individuals alike. Now is the time for cybersecurity best practices to become standard practices as more step up to deploy strong multi-factor authentication with a credential management system and hardware security keys.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://jumpcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jumpcloud_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Greg Keller, Chief Strategy Officer, JumpCloud</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We fundamentally believe that the system is the gateway to securing IT. Focusing on where the work happens—the computer in front of you—allows you to protect not only the security of individuals but also their customers.”</span></em></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Todd Peterson, Director of Product Marketing, One Identity</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the steep rise in security breaches caused by threat actors using credential theft, it’s become clear that adding additional factors to the authentication process—across all types of users—can dramatically reduce your risk.”</span></em></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Matt Hurley, VP Global Channels and Strategic Alliances, OneLogin</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Organizations are looking at ways to better secure their environment and reduce password dependency. Integrating identity management with a strong authentication method makes it convenient for end users to adopt advanced login sequences while enhancing privacy.&#8221; </span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.onionid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/onionid_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Anirban Banerjee, CEO and Founder, Onion ID</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Securing privileges in a fast paced, changing landscape of applications, servers, containers, and endpoints can be very challenging. We believe that easy yet strong authentication is the cornerstone of an effective PAM strategy.”<strong> </strong></span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://versasec.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="wp-image-351289 alignnone" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/versasec_172x49.png" /></a><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Joakim Thorén, CEO, Versasec</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Breaches are a reality both from outside and within the enterprise. Securing a company’s most vital assets with strong, easily managed two-factor authentication solutions is more than critical – it’s a moral imperative.”</span></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I am excited to share that we have added yet another stellar member to the Yubico leadership team: Wendy Spies. Wendy comes from Microsoft where she most recently directed engineering strategy and business development for cloud and AI to build new products and markets. She will be focusing on similar things here at Yubico in the role of SVP of New Business with an initial focus on YubiHSM. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wendy has more than 23 years of experience building everything from payment and hardware solutions to games and software. She has taken seven notable companies from conception to financial exit and has a long and proven track record of driving exponential growth for companies, teams, and products. Her secret? “Working with and hiring folks that are a lot smarter than me, focusing on customer needs, and measuring our success by delivering extraordinary products efficiently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s safe to say that we are lucky to have Wendy on board, and I am personally excited about the expansion of strong female leadership here at Yubico. Please join me in welcoming Wendy into the YubiFamily. To learn a little more about her background, expertise, and vision for Yubico, here is an excerpt from a recent interview between Ronnie Manning, our SVP of Communications, and Wendy.</span></p>
<p><b>What led you to join Yubico? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico was the right choice for me because each person I met with was clearly in the learning zone. Collaboration is high, and the customer focus is turned up to eleven. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that every day, one step at a time, Yubico can make the world better through product development, new standards, growing partnerships, and excellent teamwork. In the end, it wasn’t about joining a big or small company, consumer or enterprise —  it was about relentless customer focus and knowing that I was joining a team that would always have my back. This is the recipe for making profound, positive change the world, creating a lot of value, and having a really fabulous time doing it. I hope everyone finds their Yubico. </span></p>
<p><b>In your opinion, what makes a team successful?  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout my career, I’ve found that there are two simple criteria that seem to bring the magic at work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build a team that 1) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you would want to fight the zombie apocalypse with — this takes talent, passion, and opportunity and 2) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is relentlessly focused on driving customer value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you bring together talent, passion, and opportunity, you are in the zone nearly every day at work, but that doesn’t always guarantee success. You must also ensure that the team is relentlessly focused on driving customer value. Are these individuals in a learning mode? Do they come from a humble point of inquiry and are they prepared to truly listen when you answer? And are they actively talking about customers and partners?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I focus on the customer with a team of folks who have a listening and iterative mindset, we build unique customer experiences, solve wicked hard problems, and create so much value for users. Everyone wins: employees, customers, and investors.</span></p>
<p><b>What do you look forward to most during your time here at Yubico? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am proud to be part of a team at Yubico that’s securing the net for everyone and everything. We know that the only way we can do that is to make security truly easy to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look forward to the passwordless future we are building. I look forward to working across boundaries to solve some of the hardest problems of the internet. I look forward to no longer hearing stories about good folks getting their accounts hacked because passwords stink, and because hackers continue to have more resources than we do. I look forward to no longer hearing stories about devices and data being compromised because solutions are so complex that it is almost impossible to think of all of the threats, and even more impossible to remove them. And lastly, I look forward to the day when everyone can believe and see that security and usability can live together hand-in-hand. Strong vision. Clear plan. Sustained effort.</span></p>
<p><b>What do you see as the biggest market opportunity for the YubiHSM product line and how do you envision driving its growth?  </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see the YubiHSM as a natural extension of our YubiKey product line for devices and data. As a lot of folks know, anywhere a key is stored and even remotely available for others, it is at risk of being stolen — either by people on the inside of an organization, or sometimes even on the outside. The YubiHSM is a portable, low-cost solution. It can help with everything from code signing and protecting API calls to securing root of trust for something as complex as industrial IoT environments, something as legacy-bound as physical infrastructure (e.g. reactors and dams), and something as simple as cold wallets. While a few other solutions like secure enclaves and SGX could be used to solve this problem, YubiHSM provides protection for your keys in hardware that is physically isolated from operations on the server, creating yet another layer of security. This layer of security, combined with a simple, small attack surface form factor, can make it easier to adopt this technology without breaking the bank. </span></p>
<p><b>When you’re not busy changing the world and driving businesses and teams toward success, what do you do for fun? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love to engage in activities that require such deep concentration that I cannot possibly worry about the problems of the world or what to make for dinner. This ranges from the beautiful shared moments with my family playing board games to spending time early in the morning in my tiny garage throwing heavy weights into the air.  </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, at the annual September iPhone event, Apple introduced new functionality that allows the full range of YubiKey authentication on iOS via near field communication (NFC). This has been many years in the making, back in </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/10/iphone-support-yubikey-otp-via-nfc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oct 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we even wrote about when this day would come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/10/iphone-support-yubikey-otp-via-nfc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFC on iOS was read-only</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which meant that it couldn’t support modern authentication protocols like </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO U2F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/webauthn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that require both read and write capabilities &#8211; but now that has changed. With these recent updates, iPhone users (running iOS 13+) can experience mobile NFC authentication with a </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5-nfc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey 5 NFC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-nfc-by-yubico"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Key NFC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Yubico on apps and browsers that have added support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming right on the heels of our new </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/08/yubico-launches-yubikey-5ci/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey 5Ci</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, iOS users now have a broad and complete choice of secure authentication options, based on their preference and use cases. NFC-enabled YubiKeys will work with compatible apps and browsers on iPhones 7 or later running iOS 13. Older iPhone models, most iPads, and some iPods will work with the YubiKey 5Ci through its Lightning connector <a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/#protocol=all&amp;usecase=all&amp;key=-yubikey-5ci">on select apps and browsers</a>.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_522519" style="width: 369px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-522519" class="wp-image-522519" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5CNFC_-444x344.png" alt="" width="359" height="278" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5CNFC_-444x344.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5CNFC_-768x594.png 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5CNFC_-1030x797.png 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5CNFC_-705x546.png 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5CNFC_-450x348.png 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/5CNFC_.png 1331w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /><p id="caption-attachment-522519" class="wp-caption-text">The YubiKey 5C NFC is coming soon!</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not all. Based on feedback and suggestions from our customers (we hear you!), we are happy to announce a sneak preview of YubiKey 5C NFC, our upcoming USB-C security key enabled with NFC. This key will provide yet another authentication option for all environments supporting iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, and more, all on one key. Arriving this coming Winter, this new device will deliver the same multi-protocol functionality and user experience of the YubiKey 5 Series. Sign up </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-for-mobile/#sign_up_5c_nfc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to receive updates on product availability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This announcement supports Yubico’s long-standing YubiKey vision: to deliver secure hardware-based authentication across any operating system and platform. Our goal is to support all authentication use cases across any computing device, as we recognize that individuals use multiple phones, operating systems, laptops, tablets, or desktops each day to access work and personal accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To coincide with this new NFC functionality, Yubico will also be rolling out updated software for end users and developers on iOS. On mobile iOS devices, users will soon be able to use the Yubico Authenticator application to communicate over NFC, USB and Lightning connection to generate a 6 digit, time-based code commonly used by many services for 2-factor authentication. This is similar to Google Authenticator, with the main differentiator being the user credential is stored on the external YubiKey, versus internally on the mobile device, making it extremely portable to get the one-time codes either on mobile devices and/or desktop computers.  We expect to introduce the new Yubico Authenticator for iOS in the coming months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers who are interested in adding YubiKey support for desktop or mobile users, can access Yubico’s wide range of libraries on the </span><a href="https://developers.yubico.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico developer site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including SDKs for Android and iOS app developers. We are also in the process of updating our Yubico Mobile SDK for iOS to support the new iOS NFC authentication capabilities. This will allow applications to implement modern authentication protocols such as FIDO2 and support the YubiKey over both Lightning and NFC connections. </span></p>

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we launched the YubiKey 5Ci on August 20, we also introduced a new firmware to the YubiKey 5 Series: version 5.2.3. Currently, this firmware is only being shipped in the YubiKey 5Ci, however, we expect to roll out this version to all YubiKey 5 Series devices over the next month. While it is a minor update, 5.2.3 firmware has a number of features and improvements as it relates to the FIDO and OpenPGP protocol stacks.</span></p>
<p><strong>FIDO</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For FIDO2, the new firmware adds an enhanced privacy mode. This enables sites to require a PIN when a YubiKey is registered with their service. The FIDO PIN of the YubiKey must be used in order to reveal what sites the authenticator was registered to. This feature is intended for services that want to protect the privacy of what sites their users have visited for a variety of reasons. For example, assume a user registers the YubiKey with “some-website.com” and at a later point, they travel to a country where the content on “some-website.com” is discriminated against. From this person’s  YubiKey, it would not be possible to tell that the key was registered to “some-website.com” without using the PIN.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FIDO protocol has also seen a number of technical improvements, which are supported in YubiKey firmware 5.2.3:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removal of RSA, as we didn’t see any use of it in practice</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addition of  Ed25519 signature support, a modern ECC curve</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addition of  </span><a href="https://support.yubico.com/support/solutions/articles/15000027138-yubikey-5-2-3-enhancements-to-fido-2-support"><span style="font-weight: 400;">credential management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow the deletion of FIDO resident keys</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addition of PIN and no PIN support to the FIDO HMAC-secret extension for offline operations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementation of signature counters with even more privacy features including keeping per-credential offsets and randomly increasing counter values </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OpenPGP </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey Firmware 5.2.3 also has a number of enhancements to the OpenPGP implementation on the YubiKey. Most of them are related to a number of the features from the </span><a href="https://gnupg.org/ftp/specs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenPGP Smart Card Specification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> version 3.0 and above.</span></p>
<p><b>ECC Support</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenPGP 3.0 introduced support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography in addition to RSA. ECC today is by many considered a better choice for many applications and has a number of advantages including faster cryptographic operations and smaller key sizes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey Firmware version 5.2.3 and above specifically supports signatures (ECDSA) and key exchange (ECDH) from the </span><a href="https://gnupg.org/ftp/specs/OpenPGP-smart-card-application-3.4.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenPGP 3.4 spec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the following curves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From ANSI X9.62/</span><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/3/archive/2009-06-25"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIPS-186-3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ansix9p256r1</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ansix9p384r1</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ansix9p521r1</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5639"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RFC5639</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brainpoolP384r1</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brainpoolP512r1</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the PGP 3.X spec, the YubiKey now also supports:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Secp256k1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secp256k1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the curve used in BitCoin</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curve25519</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the default curve used in ssh (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EdDSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Diffie-Hellman)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Attestation</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firmware 5.2.3 also adds attestation for keys generated on device ( this capability has already been available in our PIV application stack since we launched the YubiKey 5 Series). Specifically, a YubiKey can attest that an asymmetric key was generated on, and never left, the YubiKey. For example, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a company could require that all developers sign their commits with a company-provided YubiKey that had the private key generated on device. Using the attestation keys, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system will reject any keys that were generated outside of the YubiKey and imported. Attestation was added as a Yubico-specific extension in version 3.4 of the OpenPGP Smart Card Specification. Documentation for how this feature can be used is found </span><a href="https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/Attestation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here on the Yubico developer site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Multiple Operations per Touch</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKeys can now be configured to allow multiple operations over a short period of time with a single touch to the key, a capability that was previously available in the PIV application of the YubiKey 5 Series. This can be helpful for batch signing/encryption or operations that are composed out of multiple cryptographic primitives. The behavior can be enabled or disabled by the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico is always working to advance the functionality and security of our YubiKeys, and we thank our users for their product feedback and support to drive technical improvements like the ones listed above. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today marks an exciting milestone, not only in the history of Yubico, but in the history of security keys and mobile devices. Yubico celebrates more than a decade of cutting edge contributions to the authentication market with its latest innovation, the YubiKey 5Ci, now available for purchase at our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/store/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey 5Ci is the world’s first iPhone- and iPad-friendly* security key designed to deliver strong hardware-backed authentication over a Lightning connection. But that’s not all. This key is also equipped with a USB-C connector for securely accessing hundreds of </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Works with YubiKey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applications and services on Mac, Windows, and Android devices as well. </span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL97M-h77a0" width="780" height="424" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unique dual-connector functionality of the YubiKey 5Ci, along with the signature multi-protocol features of the YubiKey 5 Series, make this key the perfect solution for consumers and enterprises alike. With support for FIDO2, WebAuthn, FIDO U2F, OTP (one-time password), PIV (Smart Card), and OpenPGP in a single device, the YubiKey 5Ci delivers strong multi-factor (MFA), second-factor (2FA), and single-factor passwordless authentication across a wide range of devices and use cases.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new web authentication standard, known as WebAuthn, was recently approved by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in March, and is rapidly gaining momentum. Since 2007, Yubico has been driving the development of open standards, and collaborating with partners to bring more secure authentication methods to users.  Through these combined efforts, we co-created WebAuthn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes WebAuthn so noteworthy is that it is supported by all major platforms and browsers, providing users with greater choice of simple authentication methods that protect against phishing attacks. With WebAuthn, users can choose to use any combination of external authenticators, such as a security key, and internal authenticators, such as a biometric keypad on a computer, to secure access to web services and applications. That’s huge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/03/w3c-standardizes-webauthn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WebAuthn in their web platforms and browsers. Support is currently on the developer preview version of Apple Safari. Upcoming support on Brave browser has been announced by Brave Software. Along with the platform and browser support, a growing number of web services have also rolled out WebAuthn support to their users, including </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/login-gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Login.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/singular-key/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singular Key</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/daon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/isosec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isosec</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/webauthn.html">Twitter</a>, and </span><a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/company/blog/posts/2019/webauthn-recommended-standard.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ping Identity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with more services committed to launching support in the near future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn is quickly gaining momentum, so we asked some of our Works with YubiKey partners to share why they decided to implement support. Here’s what they said:</span></p>
<p><b>Jasper Patterson, Web Developer, 1Password</b></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal at </span><a href="https://1password.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to make it easy for people to stay safe online, and adopting modern standards like WebAuthn helps us achieve that. Integrating WebAuthn into our existing two-factor implementation took about a week. The API is well designed and easy to work with for developers.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn offers significant security gains over traditional time-based one-time password (TOTP) or SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA), all thanks to its secure design based on public key cryptography.</span></p>
<p><b>Yves Audebert, CEO, Axiad IDS</b></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Extending Axiad ID Cloud to support WebAuthn/FIDO2 is a step forward in providing a passwordless and frictionless authentication experience to our customers. Axiad ID Cloud leverages all the features offered by YubiKeys to further our commitment to meeting our customers’ authentication needs.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axiad ID Cloud is a standards-based higher-trust identity assurance platform that provides multi-factor authentication (MFA) and dedicated PKI services to secure digital interactions. </span><a href="https://www.axiadids.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axiad IDS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expects to roll out support in the back half of this year.</span></p>
<p><b>Ben Goodman, SVP, Global Business and Corporate Development, ForgeRock</b></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ForgeRock is excited to offer WebAuthn as a native authentication option for our identity platform. Hardware authentication enabled by WebAuthn provides a more secure user authentication option, while simultaneously making for an easier, more frictionless experience. This is a &#8220;Win-Win” for end-users and application owners.”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock’s Intelligent Authentication technology has the capability to orchestrate a multitude of authentication options. WebAuthn support enables </span><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ForgeRock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to seamlessly extend that functionality to a whole new breed of devices and authenticators.</span></p>
<p><b>Jeff Broberg, Sr. Director, Product Management, OneLogin</b></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WebAuthn simplifies the rollout and adoption of MFA by enabling users to leverage authenticators across mobile and desktop platforms in a more integrated fashion. Combining external authenticators, like the YubiKey, with desktop and mobile biometric sensors benefits both enterprise admins and end users.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting strong and simple authentication is critical to secure corporate resources from advanced cyber identity threats. With WebAuthn support, </span><a href="https://www.onelogin.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OneLogin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expands their portfolio of strong authenticator options and makes it simpler for users to choose an authenticator that works best with their primary device.</span></p>
<p><b>Arshad Noor, CTO, StrongKey</b></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognize that behavior change is no easy task. Our implementation of FIDO2 and the certification of our FIDO2 server enable us to provide the ease and convenience of WebAuthn to our customers and their users through a safer and more user-friendly alternative to passwords.”</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://strongkey.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">StrongKey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been committed to providing the strongest possible level of encryption and authentication technology to keep data safe for almost two decades. With WebAuthn support, StrongKey delivers phishing-resistant authentication to their users.</span></p>
<p><b>Jai Dargan, VP Product Management, Thycotic</b></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to be a part of the Works with YubiKey program, and work together to educate customers about the benefits of strong, hardware-backed MFA.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><a href="https://thycotic.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thycotic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Yubico share the same vision that security should be easy to use, even for large organizations with dispersed teams and hundreds of thousands of assets to protect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico offers free resources and tools for rapidly implementing WebAuthn into an app or service. Visit the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico For Developers page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get started.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Yubico is happy to announce the launch of our YubiKey for Lightning </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/lightning-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner Preview Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the next phase of the YubiKey for Lightning Private Preview Program </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/01/yubico-launches-the-security-key-nfc-and-a-private-preview-of-the-yubikey-for-lightning-at-ces-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced earlier this year.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an exciting step forward for both Yubico and the Works with YubiKey ecosystem. With the launch of the Partner Preview Program, our goal is to enable more web services and applications (relying parties) to improve the protection of customer accounts and the entire account lifecycle with cross-platform support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey for Lightning Partner Preview Program includes access to iOS and Android SDKs to allow organizations to unify the user experience across all mobile platforms. Partners will also receive access to a YubiKey 5Ci preview device (formerly the YubiKey for Lightning), for development and testing. The YubiKey 5Ci has both a USB-C and Lightning connector on one device and will be generally available later this year. As part of the multi-protocol <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/">YubiKey 5 Series</a>, the YubiKey 5Ci gives developers the option of securing their iOS apps using the FIDO2, WebAuthn, U2F, OTP, PIV (smartcard) or OpenPGP protocols for passwordless or two-factor authentication. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_520146" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-520146" class="wp-image-520146 size-medium" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yk-mobile-lightning-partners-r2-2-530-444x296.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="296" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yk-mobile-lightning-partners-r2-2-530-444x296.jpg 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yk-mobile-lightning-partners-r2-2-530-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/yk-mobile-lightning-partners-r2-2-530.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /><p id="caption-attachment-520146" class="wp-caption-text">YubiKey for Lightning participating partners</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching the initial YubiKey for Lightning Private Preview Program, several notable partners have been working with us to provide feedback on our iOS developer resources. We would like to extend a special thank you to those partners, including: </span><a href="https://1password.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://brave.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brave Software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.dashlane.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dashlane</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, DoD PKI Purebred, </span><a href="https://keepersecurity.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeper Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LastPass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.secmaker.com/en/secmaker"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Secmaker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://xtn-lab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XTN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We look forward to enabling a growing list of compatible services, providing out-of-the-box uses with everyone’s favorite iOS applications when the YubiKey 5Ci becomes generally available later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Yubico extends hardware authentication capabilities to iOS, the YubiKey will be supported across all major platforms, allowing it to be the trust anchor for the rightful owner and serve as a portable </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/04/the-yubikey-as-the-webauthn-root-of-trust/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">root of trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across any computer or mobile device. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico has been a major contributor to the development of open standards for authentication from the initial development of the U2F specification to the latest W3C approved WebAuthn. As we see more services upgrade to modern authentication standards, we can’t help but share in the excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are thrilled to share that </span><a href="https://1password.com/yubikey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a password manager used by millions of individuals and 47,000 business customers worldwide, today </span><a href="https://blog.1password.com/introducing-support-for-u2f-security-keys/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support for WebAuthn, the new global standard for secure authentication on the web. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A popular request by users, 1Password has enabled the option to use WebAuthn compatible Security Keys, like the YubiKey, for two-factor authentication (2FA). This provides the highest level of hardware-based security and a great user experience for those who want to use the same security key across services, browsers, and applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“1Password and Yubico share a common mission—to make it simpler for people to stay safe online,” said Jeff Shiner, 1Password CEO. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico’s focus on security and user-friendly design aligns with our goals here at 1Password, making YubiKey 2FA a great extra layer of protection for 1Password customers.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, 1Password users were able to leverage YubiKeys as a second factor using the Yubico Authenticator app over Time-based One Time Password (TOTP). With the upgrade to WebAuthn support, 1Password takes a leap forward by enabling easier to use, faster and the most secure 2FA for their users. WebAuthn uses asymmetric (public-key) cryptography and phishing-resistant origin bound key validation for registering and authenticating with websites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Register your YubiKey with your 1Password account today by logging in to your app and following these </span><a href="https://support.1password.com/yubikey/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">setup instructions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or viewing </span><a href="https://youtu.be/4YvU31oqYmU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password’s how-to video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to know more about WebAuthn? Visit our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/webauthn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is WebAuthn?”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resource to get an overview of what it is and how users can benefit. Interested in implementing support for WebAuthn? We have developer resources for the rapid integration of WebAuthn on our </span><a href="https://developers.yubico.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Special Offer for Yubico customers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password helps businesses and families increase their online security and cut down on digital clutter by combining industry-leading security and award-winning design to make secure password management easy for everyone.</span>	 </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authentication has made significant progress over the past five years. It has matured beyond passwords with the introduction of a variety of two-factor authentication methods, and most recently, we have the advent of passwordless logins with WebAuthn, the new global standard for web authentication. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/03/w3c-standardizes-webauthn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now sets a new bar for user authentication and is considered best in class for protecting user accounts. With support in all major browsers and platforms, WebAuthn offers the opportunity for services to easily offer a wide choice of strong authentication methods to users, including a passwordless experience. This consists of using security keys or built-in authenticators such as biometric readers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To experience the WebAuthn login experience, please take a look at our </span><a href="http://demo.yubico.com/webauthn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demo site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where you can try out registering different authentication methods using WebAuthn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those curious about the additional benefits of passwordless login, we put together a list of five reasons to upgrade to WebAuthn authentication.</span></p>
<h4><b>Widespread Accessibility </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key differentiators of WebAuthn, is the widespread acceptance and adoption of the technology across major browsers, operating systems and devices. To date, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Google Android have already added support for WebAuthn, and Apple most recently announced WebAuthn support by default in </span><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8967/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-83/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safari Technology Preview Release 83</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the growing availability of built-in authenticators on computers and phones is providing users new options for authentication. As a service provider, this enables you to offer fast, convenient, and secure authentication options for all kinds of users, regardless of what kind of device or operating system they are using. </span></p>
<h4><b>Improved Security for Customers &amp; the Business</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn replaces weak password-based login or knowledge-based answers recovery with strong public key cryptography with origin checking to prevent phishing. By making strong authentication the baseline for using built-in and external hardware authenticators, users are protected from account takeovers. A </span><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent study by Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reviewed more than 350,000 wide-scale and targeted attacks, and showed that security keys were the most effective at stopping account takeovers. Not only does the elimination of password-based login protect customers from the threats of credential theft and phishing, but it also relieves your organization from the vulnerabilities associated with storing and protecting millions of user credentials.  </span></p>
<h4><b>Improved Customer Experience &amp; Brand Loyalty</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average US consumer tries to </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/is-cybersecurity-incompatible-with-digital-convenience"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep track of over 14 different passwords</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across all their websites and services. Business users are estimated to be responsible for memorizing and using an even greater number of passwords, </span><a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/88475-average-business-user-has-191-passwords"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching up to as many as 191</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The sheer number of passwords required for daily digital activities inevitably results in forgotten passwords, password resets, or at the worst, account takeovers due to weak or reused passwords. As a result, passwords degrade customer experiences, reduce brand loyalty, and contribute to lost revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passwordless login with WebAuthn provides an experience that is faster and more secure than usernames and passwords, transforming the online user experience into the familiar split-second convenience of using an ATM card. WebAuthn also enables users lacking cellular access to still authenticate when they typically might not be able to with authentication methods like one-time codes sent to mobile devices via text messages. </span></p>
<h4><b>Lower Operational Costs</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When users forget their passwords, they often end up calling help desks or support centers, consuming valuable time from support staff. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/webinars/password-management-getting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gartner estimates </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that password reset inquiries account for 20 to 50 percent of all help desk calls, which can cost large companies </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">between $5 million and $20 million annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn enables support and IT departments – including service desks and call centers — to be free from the operational overhead incurred from having to create, store, cycle, and reset passwords. It can simplify user on-boarding and given that password resets currently represent the number one IT support cost, passwordless login promises to significantly reduce workloads in IT call centers where agents today spend considerable time setting and resetting user passwords.</span></p>
<h4><b>Simple &amp; Flexible Integration Options</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn introduces the option for strong single-factor, two-factor, or multi-factor authentication. With this expanded choice of authentication flows, developers choosing to add WebAuthn support will have the option to select the authentication model that best suits their use cases and customers. This is specifically useful for organizations who require a higher level of authentication security or who may prefer a layered approach (ex: a PIN, biometric or gesture for additional protection) for certain in-app actions like changing a personal information or transferring a large sum of money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn is also backwards-compatible with FIDO U2F authenticators for a second factor use case. This means that all previously certified FIDO U2F security keys, such as the YubiKey 4 or YubiKey NEO, will continue to work as a form of second-factor authentication login with WebAuthn-enabled authentication flows. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And the winner is… WebAuthn!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago at the European Identity Conference (EIC) in Munich, WebAuthn won the award for Best Future Technology and Standard Project. As a co-chair of the W3C WebAuthn working group and lead authors of FIDO U2F/FIDO2, Yubico was invited to receive the award on behalf of all who collaborated on the standard. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_519427" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-519427" class="wp-image-519427 size-full" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/EIC-Award-Accept.png" alt="" width="403" height="216" /><p id="caption-attachment-519427" class="wp-caption-text">John Fontana, co-chair of W3C WebAuthn WG and member of the Yubico open standards team, at EIC award ceremony</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no doubt that the winning authentication standard is gaining momentum. Last week, Apple enabled default WebAuthn support on macOS in its </span><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6017/introducing-safari-technology-preview/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safari Technology Preview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while </span><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/webauthn.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/securing-your-crypto-with-security-keys-and-webauthn-551124b72d8e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced their upgrade from FIDO U2F to WebAuthn. At Yubico, our team is busier than ever supporting hundreds of services across the globe in their process of making support for the YubiKey, Security Keys and WebAuthn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially deployed by all the leading internet companies, we are excited to see WebAuthn adoption expanding across a wider range of industries,regions, and use cases including the protection of electronic identities for European citizens, blockchain technology services and financial institutions. One of the leading banks was encouraged to make support for WebAuthn after one of their customers approached them with the question, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How come authenticating to my Google and Facebook account is more secure than the service that holds my money?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FIDO U2F, FIDO2 and WebAuthn names can be confusing, but they are all part of the same standards initiative. The varying naming conventions are a result of the further development and expansion from the industry consortium FIDO Alliance (FIDO U2F and FIDO2) to the W3C web standards organization (WebAuthn). In March 2019, </span><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/03/pressrelease-webauthn-rec.html.en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">W3C approved the WebAuthn standard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is built-on, and backward compatible with U2F.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage all services to implement or migrate to WebAuthn so their end users have more choices from  an ever-expanding list of browsers and authentication options including one-factor, two-factor and passwordless login. With free open source servers and development resources available from Yubico and others, service providers are rapidly making support for WebAuthn to stop phishing and radically cut support costs. Users enjoy safer and easier login with the growing options of built-in and external FIDO/WebAuthn authenticators, also known as security keys. This award winning web authentication standard let’s everyone win — except the fraudsters!</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I’m happy to announce the addition of two new members to<a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/team/"> Yubico’s Executive Team</a> and one new board advisor. Jeff Kukowski joins us as Chief Revenue Officer, Bill Rule joins us as SVP of Global Supply Chain, and Chad Kinzelberg joins our advisory board. All three individuals bring years of expertise and proven track records in their respective fields to support Yubico’s growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authentication industry is in a period of hypergrowth and Yubico is positioned at the forefront. With </span><a href="https://www.verizondigitalmedia.com/blog/2017/07/2017-verizon-data-breach-investigations-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 81% of breaches resulting from phished or stolen credentials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and password resets costing companies upwards of $12M a month, the need for strong, hardware-backed authentication is growing globally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new members of our leadership team are critical to the continued success of the company, delivering high-quality products for customers of all sizes and industries around the world, and doing it at scale. I am personally excited to see the YubiTeam growing with the addition of such great people and talent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff joins Yubico from SecureAuth, where he served as CEO and Board Director. He has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">years of experience building companies and category-leading solutions across all stages, industry verticals, geographies, technologies and cultures. He has helped scale companies from every stage, including start up, venture-funded to exit, private equity-backed, and public company turnarounds. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yubico solves one of the most critical problems in keeping people and companies safe from attackers in one of the most secure and easiest ways for users to do so.

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new web authentication standard, </span><a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/03/pressrelease-webauthn-rec.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that was recently announced by W3C, is rapidly gaining adoption by leading platforms and services. WebAuthn is an evolution of the FIDO U2F standard, spearheaded by Yubico and Google, and successfully deployed since 2014 by millions of users with YubiKey security keys. Yubico helped to create WebAuthn to extend the standard beyond external security keys to include new internal built-in fingerprint readers and facial recognition technologies. Having these choices is important to drive widespread support for simple, strong and passwordless authentication methods.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this new authentication landscape, an external security key, such as the YubiKey, takes on the important role of a root of trust. As users move between different platforms and computing devices, having this portable root of trust is essential for enabling rapid bootstrapping on new devices and for recovering when devices are lost, stolen or replaced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a roundup of some of the best use cases for an external hardware-based authenticator:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; line-height: 28px;">
<li><b>Device Loss, Theft, or Compromise —</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case that a phone or computer is lost, stolen or replaced, the YubiKey can be used as an easy method to re-establish trust with online accounts and re-register the internal authenticator on a new device. With an external root of trust like the YubiKey, where the user’s credential cannot be tampered with, it allows a high degree of trust to be transferred from device to device and establish all of them as a trusted entity, thereby protecting the account.</span></li>
<li><b>Multi-Device Access — </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s digital age, users rarely work from a single device or platform. It’s common to move from a mobile device to desktop, laptop, or tablet, and even between personal and work devices. Having a portable external authenticator that can work across computing devices makes these transitions seamless. With options to connect via NFC, USB-A, USB-C, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/01/yubico-launches-the-security-key-nfc-and-a-private-preview-of-the-yubikey-for-lightning-at-ces-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and soon Lightning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the YubiKey meets the needs of every internet user. </span></li>
<li><b>Mobile-Restricted Environments</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — Not all work environments allow employees or contractors to have a mobile phone. Call centers, manufacturing floors, and remote locations are some of the environments where a hardware authenticator is a preferred solution.</span></li>
<li><b>High Security Applications — <span style="font-weight: 400;">Without ties to the internet or a multi-purpose chip or computing device, the attack vector naturally becomes much smaller on an external hardware authenticator. There are certain scenarios where services may choose to require step-up authentication to complete a high-risk action, such as transferring a large sum of money between bank accounts, or updating an address. The YubiKey can be used as an additional form of validation and quickly re-verify the user before the action is taken.  </span></b></li>
<li><b>Uninterrupted Access <span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; We designed the YubiKey to provide optimal levels of durability. It is crush and water resistant and does not require batteries, so it eliminates the chance of the device being uncharged. </span></b></li>
<li><b>Integration with Legacy Systems — <span style="font-weight: 400;">Most enterprises use a variety of systems, platforms, and devices, and not all of these support newer authentication standards such as FIDO and WebAuthn. Also, for use cases that require a corporate credential for computer login and remote access, digital signatures for code signing, key escrow for email encryption, or privilege access for older operating environments, the YubiKey’s multi-protocol functionality helps address a wider range of enterprise security needs.  </span></b></li>
<li><strong>Authentication Backup —</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of how users are securing their accounts, it is always a best practice to have a backup method in case the primary method of authentication is lost, stolen, broken, or inaccessible. The YubiKey is an affordable, simple option that users can carry on their keychain, tuck into a wallet, or store in a safe place for convenient access at any time.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>With a growing list of strong authentication options supported by WebAuthn, and the ability to solve use cases across device type, operating system and service, now is the time for companies to add WebAuthn to their services. Developers can take advantage of Yubico’s <a href="http://developer.yubico.com/webauthn">developer resources</a> to extend user authentication options. To try out the WebAuthn authentication experience please visit the Yubico WebAuthn <a href="http://demo.yubico.com/webauthn">demo site</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more than 3 billion people in the world connected to the internet who need — and deserve — a better more secure experience. Let’s work together toward making the internet a safer place for everyone! </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubihsm/">YubiHSM 2</a>, the world’s smallest hardware security module from Yubico, is now compatible with EJBCA software for a range of public key infrastructure (PKI) use cases. Available for all YubiHSM 2.1 and newer devices, Yubico’s updated Setup Tool, which adds support for PrimeKey EJBCA, is accessible in our <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/">latest</a> YubiHSM 2 open source software development kit (SDK).</p>
<p>When it comes to maintaining your customers’ trust, it’s imperative to protect against data theft and compromise, and hardware security modules (HSMs) are table stakes. Traditionally, this has meant dedicating an entire rack—or more—in the server room.</p>
<p>Enter the YubiHSM 2. These thumbnail-sized hardware devices deliver enhanced protection for cryptographic keys, are more affordable than traditional HSMs (<a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubihsm-2/">$650 MSRP</a>), require very low power, are ultra-portable, and plug into any USB-A port—minimizing space requirements for deployment. The sheer size and cost alone open up incredible new use cases. Imagine an autonomous vehicle with its own YubiHSM 2—no need to compromise on trunk space.</p>
<p>“The priorities for us in developing PrimeKey’s EJBCA have always been flexibility and the ability to support different use cases. With the YubiHSM 2, we enable a cost efficient and portable HSM alternative that simplifies the process to secure your CA keys,” said Chris Job, Team Leader, PrimeKey Professional Services.</p>
<p>With our latest YubiHSM 2 open source SDK, and support for PrimeKey EJBCA, YubiHSM 2 users can leverage PrimeKey and Yubico open source software and tools for implementing PKI. Collaborating with PrimeKey, and adding support for PrimeKey EJBCA on the YubiHSM 2 further delivers Yubico technology to organizations where open source is preferred or even required. The YubiHSM 2 now supports two certificate authorities—Microsoft Windows CA and PrimeKey EJBCA—offering greater flexibility to those looking to secure an organization’s most important data with an HSM.</p>

Thanks to the multi-protocol capabilities of the YubiKey, they can. The YubiKey can be used to log in to </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/linux/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/macos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mac</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or Windows machines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more popular use cases we hear about is logging into Windows machines, which is why we designed the Yubico Login for Windows Application. The tool provides a simple and secure method for YubiKey users to secure access to their Windows computers. Today, we are opening the public preview program for the application. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_508763" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-508763" class="wp-image-508763 size-medium" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2-444x296.png" alt="" width="444" height="296" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2-444x296.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2-768x511.png 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2-845x566.png 845w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2-705x469.png 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2-450x300.png 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image2.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /><p id="caption-attachment-508763" class="wp-caption-text">Yubico Login for Windows Application</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yubico Login for Windows Application will deliver a simplified configuration experience, enabling users to help protect their computers with a YubiKey.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With much of our personal and business lives now online, the need for stronger security has never been more important to protect our digital identities.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have invested considerable time from our engineering staff in the development of this new standard, including being one of nine Specification Editors, being one of two co-chairs for the W3C WebAuthn group, and having six working group members. When I asked one of our engineers from this group how he liked his job, he responded,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s one of the most interesting and scary projects I’ve ever had. We are writing code that will impact the internet security of billions of people, so we feel the responsibility to get this right!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From start to finish, the WebAuthn spec development has been more than a three-year process, but for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico, this is a culmination of more than a decade of </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/yubico-innovation-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovation and seven years of standards work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Starting first with FIDO U2F, then FIDO2 and now WebAuthn, these standards are a natural evolution built upon each other to bring together new important security capabilities for the modern web: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driverless, one-touch authentication with a single authenticator that can be used across any number of services with no shared secrets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public key cryptography to defend against phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks at scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single-factor, multi-factor and passwordless authentication for web and mobile applications. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1325F2uvImI" width="780" height="428" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn recognizes the importance of security keys as well as platform authenticators, such as built-in biometric sensors, by embracing broad support for a choice of authentication devices and modalities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico supports this approach because it fosters widespread adoption of stronger authentication.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We contributed to this standard to help as many people as possible stay safe online. Moving forward, the YubiKey will be valued as a high-privacy, high-security authentication choice. In addition, it will take on the important role of the Root of Trust, enabling seamless bootstrapping to new devices and rapid recovery from lost and stolen devices when built-in authenticators are not enabled or no longer accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Google Android have already added support for WebAuthn, and Apple Safari is actively testing the API. Additionally, Microsoft Accounts and Dropbox have WebAuthn support. Many more online services will soon follow. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since FIDO U2F was first launched in Gmail in 2014, Yubico has provided free open source code, and guided the vast majority of online services integrating the standard. We continue this work with WebAuthn. Developers and online services can rapidly add support, including “upgrading” from an existing U2F deployment, by signing up to join the Yubico </span><a href="https://developers.yubico.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developer Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be informed on the latest reference documentation, testing tools and open source servers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals and companies who want easy, secure access to their daily online accounts — including those in financial, healthcare, and government services — can accelerate adoption by </span><a href="https://ctt.ac/BAehb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requesting support for YubiKey and WebAuthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. WebAuthn works with all existing U2F and FIDO2 YubiKeys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn standardization is the foundation for the first-ever web authentication standard designed with scalable public key cryptography and phishing protections, and we can now all help to make the internet safer for everyone. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to see WebAuthn in action? Stop by the Yubico booth this week at RSA (#S2162), Scale17x (#519), or Gartner IAM Summit Europe (#S12). </span></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with </span><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Privacy Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Yubico is releasing today new research in a report entitled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2019 State of Password and Authentication Security Behaviors Report</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, conducted by Ponemon Institute. The findings reveal that despite a growing understanding of security best practices, user behavior is still falling short. The problem? Passwords continue to trip up users and compromise security and many users are not taking advantage of stronger two-factor authentication solutions that are available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual Data Privacy Day initiative, led by the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), has grown in popularity each year — and with good reason. Massive data breaches like the recent </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/collection-one-breach-email-accounts-passwords/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collection #1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continue to happen. With nearly 773 million records exposed, including email addresses and passwords, Collection #1 is one of the largest breaches to date; and yet, are individuals taking the actions needed to protect their online accounts? According to the report findings, it appears not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are we becoming more security-minded, and better yet, are we following best practices? Some of the most interesting stats revealed that:</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Click to Tweet your favorites!)</span></i></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://ctt.ac/M3ddd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 out of 3 (69%) respondents share passwords with colleagues to access accounts</span></a></p>
<p><i><a href="https://ctt.ac/HnR6r"><span style="font-weight: 400;">51 percent of respondents reuse passwords across business and personal accounts</span></a></i></p>
<p><a href="https://ctt.ac/k2HPQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">57 percent of respondents who have experienced a phishing attack have not changed their password behaviors</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://ctt.ac/Qcd86"><span style="font-weight: 400;">67 percent of respondents do not use any form of two-factor authentication in their personal life and 55 percent of respondents do not use it at work</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ctt.ac/Z_aho">57 percent of respondents expressed a preference for a login method that does not involve the use of passwords</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the above listed highlights, the full </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 State of Password and Authentication Security Behaviors Report</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivers further data on the following topics:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How privacy and security concerns affect personal password practices</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risky password practices in the workplace</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authentication and account security in organizations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differences in password practices and authentication security behaviors by age</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differences in password practices and authentication security behaviors by country (Germany, France, UK, USA)</span></p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year from Yubico! We are very excited for the upcoming year and 2019 has already kicked off with <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2019/01/yubico-launches-the-security-key-nfc-and-a-private-preview-of-the-yubikey-for-lightning-at-ces-2019/">two new product announcements</a> at CES, and now we’re expanding the Yubico family.</p>
<p>As of two weeks ago, we added another member to our executive team: Guido Appenzeller. Guido joins us as the Chief Product Officer of Yubico to focus on product development and strategy, a critical role to the company’s continued innovation and success in making strong authentication truly ubiquitous. Previously, he served as CTO of VMWare, Consulting Professor at Stanford, and the founder of two start-ups.</p>
<p>Please join me in welcoming Guido into the YubiFamily. To learn a little more about Guido here is an excerpt from a recent interview between Ronnie Manning, our VP of Communications, and Guido.</p>
<p><strong>From founding two different start-ups to working as CTO for VMWare, you have had experience with both large and small companies. While each phase of company growth presents its own set of challenges, which growth phase would you say you enjoy the most and why? </strong><br />
Both have been incredible experiences. I love small companies because of their agility and speed. You spot a new opportunity and with a good team you can have a product in the market months later. On the other hand, being an executive in a large company puts huge resources at your disposal. At VMware, we entered new markets by buying the market leader and then accelerating it with an enterprise sales team of several thousand people. In the end for me, it boils down to where I can have more overall impact and usually that is in a smaller company.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the single biggest lesson you’ve learned in your career about successfully growing a company, and how do you plan to bring that to your role at Yubico? </strong><br />
The two most important things about growing a company is the market and the team. Yubico is in a great market and solving a key problem: how to make the internet secure. Stina, Jakob and the team have done a great job creating a culture that focuses on security while at the same time emphasizing a fun user experience. That’s actually pretty rare for a security company. My goal is to keep this culture while building the lightweight process that’s needed to take Yubico through the next phases of its growth.</p>
<p><strong>You have a long history of leading companies through successful growth periods. In an ideal world, how do you envision Yubico’s growth to unfold over the next 1-5 years?</strong><br />
The short-term opportunity for Yubico is to replace passwords as the main authentication method in the internet. This is a huge shift. It would all but eliminate phishing while actually improving usability. But this is just scratching the surface. Having inexpensive hardware with advanced cryptographic functionality opens up new applications for payments, messaging security, IoT security and secure infrastructure. Long term, these are the areas that excite me most.</p>
<p><strong>What are the most exciting and daunting aspects of working in the cybersecurity industry?</strong><br />
Security is often an afterthought. We have a rich history in the technology industry of first building systems where we ignore security, then recognizing our error and eventually bolt on a security solution that is awkward to use and difficult to understand. I think what initially got me excited about the YubiKey is that it is one of the very few security products that is easy to understand and that end users actually love to use.</p>
<p><strong>When you’re not busy tackling the roles and responsibilities of a Chief Product Officer, what are most likely to be doing?</strong><br />
I love the outdoors and like exploring the world on foot, scuba diving or behind the controls of a small airplane that I have flown all the way from California to the Caribbean. I am an avid gamer with my kids or alone, and recently have been spending more and more time in Virtual Reality.</p>
<p><em>The Yubico team will continue to grow in 2019. If you’re interested in a career in cybersecurity at Yubico, check out our open job opportunities <a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/careers/">here</a>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello from Las Vegas. Today, we have some exciting news for you that’s coming straight from the CES show floor. We are introducing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new device form factors: our latest next-generation security key, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-nfc-by-yubico/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Key NFC by Yubico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a private preview of our YubiKey for Lightning. We are giving live demos of both of these keys at the CES Yubico booth (#312).</span></p>
<p><b>The Security Key NFC </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Security Key NFC is our newest addition to our distinctive blue </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/security-key/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Key Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, offering USB-A and NFC (near-field communication) for tap-and-go authentication over the FIDO U2F and FIDO2/WebAuthn protocols on computers and supported mobile devices (like an Android phone or a NFC reader attached to a Windows 10 computer). With the option of multiple communication methods, this one key is able to deliver a simple and seamless user experience across multiple devices for strong multi-factor, two-factor (2FA), and single-factor passwordless authentication. </span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V-h3qHo8y2Q" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Security Key NFC works out of the box with hundreds of services already supporting FIDO U2F and FIDO2 authentication protocols: including Microsoft (for passwordless login), Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, a growing list of password managers, and many more </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/#key=-security-key-by-yubico&amp;usecase=all"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 and U2F compatible websites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And as the the latest hardware authenticator from Yubico, it’s built to last. It’s made in the USA and Sweden with reinforced fiberglass that is hermetically sealed and injection molded into a monolithic block, delivering exceptional physical durability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Security Key NFC by Yubico is available beginning today for $27 at the Yubico </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/store/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>YubiKey for Lightning — Private Preview</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a Yubico follower, you’ve probably heard that Yubico’s goal is to make strong, simple authentication truly ubiquitous, across all services, devices, and operating systems. Historically iOS has presented </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/10/iphone-support-yubikey-otp-via-nfc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieving that mission, which is why we’re extremely excited to announce a private preview of our newest YubiKey for Lightning.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_487506" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-487506" class="wp-image-487506 size-medium" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iphone_lightning_macbook-444x296.jpg" alt="" width="444" height="296" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iphone_lightning_macbook-444x296.jpg 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iphone_lightning_macbook-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iphone_lightning_macbook-1030x687.jpg 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iphone_lightning_macbook-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iphone_lightning_macbook-705x470.jpg 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/iphone_lightning_macbook-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /><p id="caption-attachment-487506" class="wp-caption-text">YubiKey for Lightning</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey for Lightning is a multi-protocol hardware authenticator designed with both USB-C and Lightning connectors. By supporting the two most common connectors for Mac and iPhones, the new YubiKey for Lightning, is designed to provide seamless authentication across compatible desktop and mobile devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also formally launching the YubiKey for Lightning Program as an extension of our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/08/yubico-extends-mobile-sdk-for-ios-to-lightning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced in August 2018. If you are a developer or service that would like to support strong hardware authentication on iOS, we invite you to work with us by </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/lightning-key-preview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applying </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to participate in the YubiKey for Lightning Program. Selected participants will have access to the private preview of YubiKey for Lightning and also the Yubico Mobile iOS SDK for Lightning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the YubiKey for Lightning is in private preview to selected participants in the Yubikey for Lightning Program, with general availability still to be announced.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 was an awesome year for Yubico. It was full of new product launches, business milestones, a growing team of super stars, and industry-leading innovations. It’s hard to believe that all of that happened in just one year, but it’s amazing to see how much can be accomplished together when we focus on our mission of making security available for all.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, I’ve also learned that it’s </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessary</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reflect on all of these accomplishments as an entrepreneur, a CEO, or an employee. This time of pause allows us to evaluate the lessons learned, set new goals, and carefully build upon the work we’ve already done. So, as we cross into 2019, here’s a quick look back at some of Yubico’s finest moments of 2018. </span></p>
<p><strong>We invested a significant amount of time and resources into product innovation and released several major new products, all of them being the first of their kind on the market.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/aws-iot-greengrass-now-enables-simplified-deployments-enhanced-security-and-greater-flexibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Web Service (AWS) Internet of Things (IoT) Greengrass</a> users can now use  the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubihsm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YubiHSM 2</a>, Yubico’s ultra-portable hardware security module, for secure key storage. AWS IoT Greengrass software provides local compute, messaging, and data caching for the IoT devices, enabling users to run IoT applications across the AWS cloud and local devices.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet of Things (2018) research report</a> from Business Insider Intelligence predicts that there will be more than 55 billion IoT devices by 2025, up from about 9 billion in 2017. While reaping many advantages like increased efficiency and productivity, this rapid growth in adoption provides a new playground for malicious actors creating real challenges for security and privacy.</p>
<p>Connecting everything to the cloud creates the potential for a single point of failure, which is why protecting access to servers is of paramount importance. A prime threat to access is storing root keys for servers in software. Root keys stored in software can be stolen, accidentally distributed, or misused, and can potentially lead to catastrophic security breaches.</p>
<p>AWS IoT Greengrass enables customers to leverage a hardware root of trust, such as the YubiHSM 2, for private key storage, and end-to-end encryption for messages sent between AWS IoT Greengrass Core and the AWS cloud, as well as between the AWS IoT Greengrass Core and compatible local devices. This provides AWS IoT Greengrass customers with the option to configure their AWS IoT Greengrass Core to use the private keys generated and stored on the YubiHSM 2.</p>
<p>“Security and compliance are primary considerations for customers as they begin their respective cloud journeys. Organizations need true cloud visibility, which is the foundation of security and controls. The integration of YubiHSM 2 with AWS IoT Greengrass is a great example of a way for customers to have greater visibility into local compute, messaging, and data caching for the Internet of Things (IoT), ” said Troy Bertram, General Manager, Worldwide Public Sector Business Development, AWS. “The integration of YubiHSM 2 with AWS IoT Greengrass provides AWS customers with another avenue to maintain the strong hardware-backed security for cryptographic digital key generation, storage, and management.”</p>
<p>Since our initial launch of the YubiHSM 2 last year, many of our customers have approached us looking for a way to protect keys on servers. Complaints of traditional rack-mounted and card-based HSMs offering limited applicability at a significantly higher cost have led customers to our innovative alternative hardware security module. The YubiHSM 2 provides strong hardware-backed security for cryptographic digital key generation, storage, and management. The nano-sized YubiHSM 2 fits inside a server’s USB port and does not require additional hardware, significantly bringing down costs and simplifying the deployment process.</p>
<p>We’re excited for the collaboration with AWS IoT Greengrass. This announcement follows our recent <a href="https://www.yubico.com/press-releases/yubico-introduces-open-source-yubihsm-sdk-for-securing-infrastructures-and-hardware-private-key-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> of our open source software development kit (SDK) for the YubiHSM 2. Now, more developers can rapidly integrate the YubiHSM 2’s capabilities into apps across a wider array of architectures and platforms. The YubiHSM 2 SDK enables developers to build products that communicate seamlessly with the YubiHSM 2 through the industry standard PKCS#11, and extend a range of high security functions and use cases for the greater protection of cryptographic keys.</p>
<p>The open source YubiHSM 2 SDK highlights Yubico’s commitment to transparency and trust. We continue to encourage the developer and security communities to join us in our mission to make strong hardware-backed security more accessible to organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/aws-iot-greengrass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more</a> about this new feature, and how AWS IoT Greengrass works with the YubiHSM 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve done it! Together, with Microsoft, we’ve officially made it possible for hundreds of millions of Microsoft users around the world to log in without a password on their personal </span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=en-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft accounts (MSA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a YubiKey 5 or Security Key by Yubico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest update to Windows 10 (version 1809) and existing native support in Edge, all consumer Microsoft accounts now support <a href="https://www.yubico.com/go-password-less/microsoft" target="_blank">password-less login</a> via </span><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yes, no passwords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a Microsoft account and the YubiKey, you can quickly and securely log in (and automatically single-sign-on) to all of these Microsoft services on Edge:</span></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-455317 size-large aligncenter" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msa_rd1-1030x369.png" alt="" width="1030" height="369" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msa_rd1-1030x369.png 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msa_rd1-444x159.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msa_rd1-768x275.png 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msa_rd1-1500x537.png 1500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msa_rd1-705x252.png 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msa_rd1-450x161.png 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/msa_rd1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
That’s one login, zero passwords, and effortless access to your most loved Microsoft services.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just take a moment for that to sink in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2018/11/20/sign-in-to-your-microsoft-account-without-a-password-using-windows-hello-or-a-security-key/">announcement from Microsoft</a> is a landmark in the history of authentication. The first driverless, one-touch authentication USB device was launched in 2008, in the form of the original one-time password (OTP) YubiKey. To improve protection against phishing and advanced attacks, and make it work with any number of services with no shared secrets, Yubico co-created U2F with Google, that was later contributed to the FIDO Alliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To remove the need for a username and long complicated passwords, we worked with Microsoft and the FIDO Alliance to evolve U2F into FIDO2 for password-less login.  We say thank you to everyone who has been part of making this a reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Password-less sign-in is a transformational change to how business users and consumers access devices and applications. It combines industry-best ease of use and security to create an experience people are going to love and hackers are going to hate,” said Alex Simons, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Identity Division. “FIDO2 is a key part of Microsoft’s push to eliminate passwords and devices like the YubiKey 5 are a great example of how we’re working with partners to make this transformation a reality.”</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify what type of YubiKey you have (USB or NFC) and select Next.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be redirected to the setup experience where you will insert or tap your YubiKey 5 or Security Key. This action generates a unique public-private key pair between your YubiKey and your Microsoft account, and only the YubiKey stores the private key. It never leaves your device.The public key is stored with the Microsoft service to allow for verification of your authentication.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will then be prompted to set a unique PIN to protect your key. This PIN is stored locally on the YubiKey—not with Microsoft accounts.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the follow-up action by touching YubiKey gold sensor.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Name your security key so that you can distinguish it from other keys (we always recommend setting up an additional YubiKey for back up)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign out and open Microsoft Edge, select use security key instead, and sign in by inserting or tapping your key and entering your PIN.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s it! You have successfully replaced your Microsoft account password with strong, hardware-based authentication using public key cryptography to protect against phishing and man-in-the-middle.

<p><b>Authenticating Beyond Your Microsoft Account</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to FIDO2, the YubiKey 5 series supports: FIDO U2F, PIV (smart card), OpenPGP, Yubico OTP, OATH-TOTP, OATH-HOTP, and challenge-response. This means the same device that you use to protect your Microsoft account can be used to protect your password manager, social media accounts, and your logins to hundreds of services.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we are announcing some exciting news that we know you’ve all been waiting for. The 5th generation YubiKey has arrived! </span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7jMarlnxac" width="780" height="424" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new YubiKey 5 Series is comprised of four multi-protocol security keys, including two much anticipated new features: FIDO2 / WebAuthn and NFC (near field communication). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey 5 Series is the industry’s first set of multi-protocol security keys to support </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/"> WebAuthn</a>, the open authentication standard that Yubico helped to pioneer, along with Microsoft and others. All leading platforms and browsers have either made support or are engaged in this standards work, expanding authentication choices using authentication devices, such as a YubiKey, with or without a username and password. Each key in the YubiKey 5 series supports: FIDO2 / WebAuthn, FIDO U2F, PIV (smart card), OpenPGP, Yubico OTP, OATH-TOTP, OATH-HOTP, and challenge-response. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the new YubiKey 5 series, Yubico provides a solution that not only works for today’s authentication scenarios, but into tomorrow’s, helping to bridge the gap from existing solutions to a </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/04/yubico-and-microsoft-introduce-passwordless-login/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">future of passwordless login</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Users will receive the same trusted security, ease of use, and durability expected from a YubiKey, but will now have the added option of passwordless logins using FIDO2:</span></p>
<div id="attachment_386137" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386137" class="wp-image-386137 size-full" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screen-Shot-2018-09-13-at-3.52.07-PM.png" alt="" width="281" height="459" /><p id="caption-attachment-386137" class="wp-caption-text">Authentication options with the YubiKey 5 Series.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b style="font-size: 16px;">Single-Factor Authentication (Passwordless) with the YubiKey 5 Series &#8211; </b>The YubiKey 5 security keys can be used alone for strong single-factor authentication, requiring no username or password to login — just tap or touch to authenticate.</span></p>
<p><b>Second-Factor Authentication with the YubiKey 5 Series &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used alongside a username and password, the YubiKey 5 series offers a strong second factor of authentication. This is the YubiKey integration that exists today with services like Google, Twitter, and Facebook, and it is most familiar to our users. </span></p>
<p><b>Multi-Factor Authentication (Passwordless + PIN + Touch) with the YubiKey 5 Series &#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey 5 series can be used in conjunction with a PIN for user verification. In this case, the PIN unlocks the device locally and touch is still required for the YubiKey to perform the authentication.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this expanded choice of authentication modes, developers choosing to add support for the YubiKey will have the option to choose the authentication model that best suits their use cases and customers. Implementation resources for all of the YubiKey-supported protocols can be found on the </span><a href="https://developers.yubico.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Developer website </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or through the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Developer Program mailing list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another much anticipated feature added with the YubiKey 5 series, is the addition of NFC to the YubiKey 5 NFC device, allowing for a seamless and secure tap-and-go experience with mobile devices or external NFC readers.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_386133" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386133" class="wp-image-386133 size-medium" title="YubiKey 5 NFC with FIDO2 and NFC" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YK5_NFC_Keychain-444x296.jpg" alt="YubiKey 5 NFC" width="444" height="296" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YK5_NFC_Keychain-444x296.jpg 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YK5_NFC_Keychain-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YK5_NFC_Keychain-1030x687.jpg 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YK5_NFC_Keychain-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YK5_NFC_Keychain-705x470.jpg 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/YK5_NFC_Keychain-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /><p id="caption-attachment-386133" class="wp-caption-text">YubiKey 5 NFC</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining the security and usability features of FIDO2 passwordless authentication and tap-and-go NFC provides an optimal user experience, and drastically improves security and productivity. This is especially beneficial in fast-paced, dispersed working environments within sectors such as financial services, healthcare, and retail point-of-sale (POS). FIDO2 is the first open standard authentication protocol that can take tap-and-go authentication to the masses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey 5 Series includes: YubiKey 5 NFC, YubiKey 5 Nano, YubiKey 5C, and YubiKey 5C Nano. To determine the key that is best for you, please reference the online </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/compare-yubikeys/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comparison chart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or take our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/quiz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey quiz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></p>

This technology enables organizations to address expanding security concerns and regulatory requirements within and beyond their employee base, while also reducing complexity for the end user by having as few as one identity to access all the different tools, systems, and programs required to do their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our work with the IAM vendor community has proven there are many scenarios where mobile phone use is restricted or even prohibited for varying reasons. Call centers and hospitals, as well as high-security environments like government agencies and financial institutions, require strong authentication to protect sensitive data and assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, call centers are tightly controlled environments from a time/work perspective. Performance control is another important aspect—the less distractions, the higher throughput from staff. Arguably more important is privacy. Call centers do not allow mobile phones in an effort to protect customer data from misuse and abuse, which means another form factor becomes essential to enabling MFA.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Partner, Ping Identity, offers an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) platform called PingID. With the YubiKey and PingID together, customers receive a comprehensive hardware-backed MFA solution for both high-security and phone-free environments. The joint enterprise-wide solution offers tailored authentication policies for administrators, and at the same time, provides simple, secure access for users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ping Identity’s partnership with Yubico gives an enterprise the convenience and flexibility of mobile app-based or hardware-based MFA to deliver the right level of assurance to match risk across an ever-increasing number of access points. With MFA everywhere these days, admins are looking for a way to centrally manage </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MFA use cases. Native support for YubiKey helps an organization get much closer to that goal,” said Edward Killeen, Partner Marketing Manager, Ping Identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With PingID, admins easily define advanced authentication policies and layer strong YubiKey MFA when and where needed. This affords users the flexibility to harness hardware-backed protection at any time and from anywhere. PingID’s native support for certified YubiKey hardware and YubiOTP (One Time Password) also enables enterprises to eliminate the need to manually type codes, not only saving on time, but also improving employee productivity. A strong testament to durability and reliability, the YubiKey does not require batteries or network connectivity, so it is always on and accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using PingID and the YubiKey together helps enterprises safeguard their most sensitive data, and effectively mitigates the risk of security breaches.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Yubico announced a </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/05/yubikey-comes-to-iphone-with-mobile-sdk-for-ios-and-lastpass-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile SDK for iOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enable Yubico OTP authentication over NFC on iPhones. Today, we are pleased to announce that we are extending the Yubico Mobile SDK to enable rapid implementation of FIDO U2F over a lightning connection for iOS apps. We invite developers to join the Yubico Lightning Project to work with us to broaden authentication options for iOS applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is, overall usage of mobile devices is on the rise. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.zenithmedia.com/mobile-forecasts-75-internet-use-will-mobile-2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">79% of internet use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is predicted to be on mobile by the end of 2018. Yubico’s goal has always been to make strong, simple online security truly ubiquitous, regardless of service, device, and/or operating system. However, making a hardware authenticator, such as the YubiKey, work in a secure and seamless way with iOS has been a challenge for us and the rest of the industry over the past few years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have researched and prototyped various iOS solutions and believe that NFC (near field communication) and USB are optimal communications transports for external authenticators because of security and usability. While it’s always possible that Apple may further open up support for NFC or USB interfaces in the future, this is currently limited or not accessible on today’s iOS devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yubico Lightning Project is designed to address these issues, with rollout in several phases. Phase one introduces our extended Mobile SDK for iOS, which enables developers to add U2F authentication to iOS apps via a lightning connection. This approach enables apps and services to have out-of-the-box U2F support. Following phases will be communicated in the future.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our customers love the security and ease of use of U2F Yubico security keys on their Keeper desktop and web app. Providing this ability to all users on their iPhone and Android devices is an amazing and exciting capability we&#8217;ll be ready to deploy as soon as it becomes available,&#8221; said Craig Lurey, CTO and Co-Founder of Keeper Security.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Multi-factor authentication is a must for all organizations, helping to mitigate credential-based attacks and ensuring only the right people have access to the information they need to do their work. By working with companies like Yubico alongside our own MFA offering, we’re able to continue to provide organizations with options for simple, seamless ways to layer security on all of the devices the modern workforce is using today,” said Joe Diamond, Sr. Director of Security Product Marketing, at Okta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers who are interested in taking advantage of strong U2F authentication for iOS apps, are invited to </span><a href="https://yubico.com/lightning-project"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sign up here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to receive more information about the Lightning Project. We also encourage you to sign up for the Yubico Developer Program </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mailing list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stay updated on new developer resources as they become available. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, we’re headed to Las Vegas for none other than the Black Hat Expo, and we’ll be showcasing all kinds of YubiKey goodness. We’ll be at booth #463, so if you’re there stop by to say hello. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a taste of what you can expect: </span></p>
<p><b>Passwordless Login Demos </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been keeping up with us and the authentication space, you’ll know that a passwordless future is here thanks to the introduction of the new </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 open standard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico is a core contributor to this standard, and we’ve got a device that can deliver on the passwordless login experience —</span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Security Key by Yubico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And you guessed it, we’ll be demoing a tap-and-go login flow (no passwords needed) at Black Hat on an Azure Active Directory environment with the Security Key by Yubico. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl479T2t6eo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catch a sneak peek</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></p>
<p><b>New Developer Resources</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been hard at work on our recently launched Yubico Developer Program, and we’re happy to share some of our latest resources with you at BlackHat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our hottest new offerings is our Mobile SDK for iOS. In case you missed it, LastPass leveraged our Mobile SDK for iOS to enable </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNpsqEjcJRI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the YubiKey NEO to authenticate to the LastPass iOS app via NFC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (we’ll have demos at the booth). The Mobile SDK for iOS is hosted on our </span><a href="https://developers.yubico.com/Software_Projects/Mobile%20iOS%20SDK/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and open for all developers to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven’t heard about our Developer Program, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sign up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for our mailing list and we’ll keep you in the loop on what’s new. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_364520" style="width: 232px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-364520" class="wp-image-364520 size-medium" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/y-sign-r1-02-1-Resized-444x686.jpg" alt="" width="222" height="343" /><p id="caption-attachment-364520" class="wp-caption-text">Look for me!</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Featured YubiKey Integrations</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here at Yubico, we like to say, “The YubiKey works with many, many locks.” We’ve built so much power, security, and usability into one little device, and those features are built upon by all of the services and applications that support the YubiKey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why we love our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/#all"><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so much. Keep your eyes peeled and see if you can spot the “Works with YubiKey” standees when you’re walking the show floor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of our partners will have these featured at their booths and will be giving demos of their own YubiKey integrations. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any of this sounds interesting, or even if you’d just like to meet the people behind </span><strong>the key</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, please come say hi. We’re at booth #463, and we’d love to meet you and talk all things YubiKey. </span></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry moved one step closer to passwordless login with this week’s </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/07/30/introducing-web-authentication-microsoft-edge/#AGxO48gsRzCgGHfc.97"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that starting with Microsoft Edge </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/07/25/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17723-and-build-18204/#YzizR60Ot2PEHQCp.97"><span style="font-weight: 400;">build 17723</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the browser will support FIDO2 strong first-factor and multifactor <a href="https://www.yubico.com/go-passwordless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passwordless login</a>, and second-factor authentication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge all engaged to support WebAuthn, we have two-thirds of all major web browsers backing this next-generation protocol. In March this year, W3C Web Authentication Working Group announced that </span><a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/webauthn/2018/03/20/candidate-recommendation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn reached Candidate Recommendation (CR)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> status, meaning with high interoperability, any browser could add support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is exciting news for developers, application creators, and those who want to secure their services with WebAuthn and FIDO2 to enable a passwordless login experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a leading contributor and driver of the FIDO2 and WebAuthn open authentication standards, Yubico is committed to helping the larger developer community navigate implementation. Earlier this year we launched a new </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developer Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help developers rapidly integrate with these new standards. Over 1000 companies have registered to date with the program to find resources to help them become successful in integrating FIDO2. Most recently Yubico hosted an expert </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-videos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2/WebAuthn webinar series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused specifically on FIDO2 and WebAuthn education and deployment: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 Authentication Demystified</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 WebAuthn Data Flows, Attestation, and Passwordless Technical Overview</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 WebAuthn Server Validation Technical Overview</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With new WebAuthn browser support available in Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, a FIDO2 compatible hardware-based authenticator — such as the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Key by Yubico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — can replace a username and password as a much stronger form of single-factor authentication. WebAuthn still allows for the second-factor authentication and also support the use of PIN or biometrics with both external and platform authenticators for a multi-factor passwordless login experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FIDO2 momentum is strong and we encourage developers and security architects interested in the new standard to sign up for our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-program"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Developer Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mailing list to stay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">up-to-date on workshops, webinars, implementation guides, reference code, APIs and SDKs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New content is being added on an ongoing basis with the next FIDO2 resources becoming available later this month. </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those that are still unfamiliar with FIDO2 and WebAuthn, visit our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/08/10-things-youve-been-wondering-about-fido2-webauthn-and-a-passwordless-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that answers some of the most common questions we’ve received about the standard so far.</span></em></p>

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with a mission to deliver a more secure internet, Yubico has been working closely with Microsoft, Google, the </span><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-and-w3c-achieve-major-standards-milestone-in-global-effort-towards-simpler-stronger-authentication-on-the-web/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO Alliance and W3C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create and drive open standards that pave the way for the future of passwordless login. The </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 standard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the new standard enabling the replacement of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> weak password-based authentication with strong hardware-based authentication using public key (asymmetric) cryptography.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 has created quite a buzz in the security community, and as with any new technology, there’s always a bit of a learning curve. Earlier this year, we introduced our updated </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Developer Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help developers get up to speed quickly with FIDO2 and WebAuthn.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few weeks, we have run a </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-videos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 webinar series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for developers to provide background on the FIDO2 specification and how to implement. During the course of this webinar series, we have answered many questions about the specifics of the FIDO2 standard and WebAuthn, including how it relates to our new </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Key by Yubico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the evolution of a passwordless world. We wanted to share the most commonly asked questions and answers, that you also may have wondered about.</span></p>
<p><b>Are FIDO2 and WebAuthn the same thing? If not, how are they different?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 is comprised of two standardized components, a web API (WebAuthn) and a Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). The two work together and are required to achieve a passwordless experience for login. The earlier FIDO U2F protocol working with external authenticators is now renamed to CTAP1 in the WebAuthn specifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Chrome and Firefox announcing WebAuthn API and CTAP1 support as the client, and </span><a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/05/introducing-webauthn-support-for-secure-dropbox-sign-in/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now integrating with the WebAuthn API, this has kicked off a flurry of integration activities by other services. Most recently, Microsoft Edge </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/07/30/introducing-web-authentication-microsoft-edge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for WebAuthn API, CTAP1 and CTAP2, making it the browser with the widest authentication support.</span></p>

<p><b>Is FIDO2 backwards-compatible with current YubiKey models?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WebAuthn component of FIDO2 is </span><a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/04/pressrelease-webauthn-fido2.html.en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backwards-compatible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with FIDO U2F authenticators via the CTAP1 protocol in the WebAuthn specifications. This means that all previously certified FIDO U2F Security Keys and YubiKeys will continue to work as a second-factor authentication login experience with web browsers and online services supporting WebAuthn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new FIDO2 passwordless experience will require the additional functionally of CTAP2, which is currently only offered in the new Security Key by Yubico. CTAP2 is not supported in previous FIDO U2F Security Keys, or current YubiKey 4 series, or the YubiKey NEO.</span></p>
<p><b>Is FIDO2 considered single factor, two-factor or multi-factor authentication? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Login with a FIDO2-enabled hardware device, such as the Security Key by Yubico, offers a greater choice for strong authentication including: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">single factor passwordless</span></li>
<li>two-factor (2FA)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With FIDO2, a hardware-based authenticator — such as the Security Key by Yubico — can replace a username and password as a much stronger form of single factor authentication. Users can also continue to use the Security Key by Yubico as a second factor. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, for added security, a FIDO2 hardware authenticator can be combined with an additional factor, such as a PIN or biometric gesture, to enable strong multi-factor authentication.</span></p>
<p><b>How secure is FIDO2 compared to FIDO U2F and other 2FA solutions? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Single factor login with FIDO2 offers strong authentication as a single factor. In many cases, this single factor authentication is more secure than other forms of two-factor authentication (such as SMS), as there are no secrets that can be phished remotely when using FIDO2. FIDO2 single factor uses the same strong public key cryptography with origin checking to prevent phishing just like FIDO U2F, but with the additional convenience of not needing usernames and passwords as the first factor to identify the user.</span></p>
<p><b>Will FIDO U2F become obsolete with the expansion of FIDO2? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 WebAuthn is backwards compatible with FIDO U2F authenticators, so over time, we expect FIDO2 will subsume FIDO U2F. </span></p>
<p><b>Is there an option to use FIDO2 in conjunction with an additional factor such as a pin or biometrics? Is this recommended? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardware authenticators supporting CTAP2 can add user verification by requiring users to use a PIN or biometric to unlock the hardware authenticator so it can perform its role. This preference is primarily dependent on the implementor’s threat vectors as well as use cases. For example, a large banking institution may want to consider the use of a PIN in conjunction with a security key for a higher level of assurance, while a warehouse-based shared kiosk environment may not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Security Key by Yubico is enabled with the full CTAP2 specs, and is fully enabled to support several passwordless experiences including single factor touch-and-go using the hardware authenticator (no need for a username) as well as use of a PIN with touch of the hardware authenticator.</span></p>
<p><b>What’s the difference between a PIN and password?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As stated above, one of the allowances with FIDO2 is the option to combine hardware-based authentication with an additional factor such as a PIN. This has many of you wondering, “Well, isn’t that the same as needing to remember a password?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A PIN is actually different than a password. The purpose of the PIN is to unlock the Security Key so it can perform its role. A PIN is stored locally on the device, and is never sent across the network. In contrast, a password is sent across a network to the service for validation, and that can be phished. In addition, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">since the PIN is not part of the security context for remotely authenticating the user, the PIN does not need the same security requirements as passwords that are sent across the network for verification. This means that a PIN can be much simpler, shorter and does not need to change often, which reduces concerns and IT support loads for reset and recovery. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the hardware authenticator with a PIN provides a passwordless, phishing-resistant solution for authentication.</span></p>
<p><b>How does FIDO2 affect a company&#8217;s password policy of replacing passwords every 90 days?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With FIDO2, there’s no need to replace passwords, as there are no passwords required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those combining a hardware authenticator with a PIN, it’s important to note that PINs do not demand the same security requirement as a password. A PIN and a password are different. Since a PIN is not part of the security context for remotely authenticating the user (the PIN is not sent over the network for verification), it can be much simpler and less complex than a password, and does not need to be changed with the same frequency (or at all), which eases enterprise concerns about PIN reset and recovery. </span></p>
<p><b>What services provide support for FIDO2? When can we expect additional services to roll out support? </b></p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/05/nic67"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrome,</span></a> <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/05/09/firefox-gets-down-to-business-and-its-personal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firefox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/05/introducing-webauthn-support-for-secure-dropbox-sign-in/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have implemented support for WebAuthn second-factor login flow. Beginning with build 17723, </span><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/07/30/introducing-web-authentication-microsoft-edge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Edge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now supports the candidate release version of WebAuthn. This latest version of Edge is able to support FIDO2 strong single factor and multi-factor authentication, in addition to the second factor. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yubico Developer Program offers comprehensive resources for those interested in adding support for FIDO2. </span></p>
<p><b>What if I lose my Security Key by Yubico? Without a password, am I locked out of my account?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practice is always to ensure that you have a backup Security Key in place, should you misplace your primary device. The Security Key by Yubico contains no identifiable information, so if it were to be found, it could not immediately be used to login without knowing the identity of the owner and to which accounts it is registered. The reality is that the primary attack vector for consumers and enterprises is </span><b>remote account takeover</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — whether by credential theft, phishing scams, or man-in-the-middle attacks. FIDO2 and the Security Key by Yubico are specifically designed to protect against these types of threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who are concerned with physical threats, the option is there to require multi-factor authentication using a PIN for additional protection. That way, if someone obtains a stolen Security Key, they will still need to know which accounts it is registered with, and also have access to your additional factor (PIN) to be able to log in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant benefit of an open authentication standard is that the number of implementations are limitless. With </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox working as the client and </span><a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/05/introducing-webauthn-support-for-secure-dropbox-sign-in/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dropbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> working as the service, all have announced WebAuthn support with many more in the works. We’re well on our way to the future of passwordless login! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to be a part of the future of passwordless login? </span></p>

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the principal inventor behind both the Security Key and U2F protocol, we are true supporters of open standards. To realize our mission of making secure login ubiquitous, we designed the original Security Key, and provided the majority of the open source code and test tools for FIDO U2F and the latest version of the standard, FIDO2, which offers a passwordless experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovation is core to all we do, and as the ecosystem continues to mature, U2F and FIDO2 functionality will come in many different form factors, communications methods (USB/BLE/NFC) and features, from Yubico and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past several years, Google has deployed hundreds of thousands of FIDO U2F-enabled Yubico devices internally with amazing </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/none-of-googles-employees-get-phished-because-of-yubikey-security-key-2018-7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, Google released their own version of a security key, and while we have received the question if we were part of this production, these devices are not manufactured by Yubico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico strongly believes there are security and privacy benefits for our customers by manufacturing and programming our products in the USA and Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s offering includes a Bluetooth (BLE) capable key. While Yubico previously initiated development of a BLE security key, and contributed to the BLE U2F standards work, we decided not to launch the product as it does not meet our standards for security, usability and durability. BLE does not provide the security assurance levels of NFC and USB, and requires batteries and pairing that offer a poor user experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico is a believer in NFC, and the YubiKey NEO design has proven at scale to deliver a superior contactless user experience for U2F.  Also, Yubico will soon announce another secure and user friendly solution for iOS.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_156521" style="width: 395px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156521" class="wp-image-156521" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/YubiKeyFamily_600x300_3-444x222.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="193" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/YubiKeyFamily_600x300_3-444x222.jpg 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/YubiKeyFamily_600x300_3-450x225.jpg 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/YubiKeyFamily_600x300_3.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /><p id="caption-attachment-156521" class="wp-caption-text">YubiKey authentication devices</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards work has been a long, challenging and inspiring journey convincing and engaging all leading platforms and browsers to subscribe to the Yubico mission: to make secure login easy and available for everyone.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U2F is just one tool in the YubiKey toolbox. Today, the majority of our customers use our multi-function </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKeys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across multiple applications, services, and operating systems. In addition to FIDO U2F, we offer smart card (PIV), Yubico OTP, OpenPGP, and OATH-HOTP/TOTP, in a single device, over both USB and NFC, as well as in USB-C form factors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico continues to work closely with Microsoft, Google and the global open standards community on FIDO2, the passwordless evolution of U2F. This next-generation standard enables the option to use a security key as a single factor, with an optional PIN or biometrics on the user device, removing the need for service providers to store and manage passwords. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will continue to create market defining authentication products, which we are currently demonstrating at Google Cloud Next, booth #S1426. We welcome you to join us.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are your go-to apps? There are several applications and services that many of us use weekly, and in most cases, daily — Gmail, Facebook, Dropbox, a password manager — and the good news is that all of these support the YubiKey for strong authentication. And now, there is one more to add to the list!   </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of last month, Twitter users can now protect their accounts with </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO U2F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two-factor authentication using a </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-4-series/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Key by Yubico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This new feature is now available to all 328 million of Twitter’s monthly active users for both personal and business accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter has some simple set up instructions </span><a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/two-factor-authentication#security-key"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for using on your computer. Once you register your YubiKey with Twitter, you will be required to present the key each time you login to your account in the future. It will ask for your username and password, and then it will ask for your YubiKey. Just insert the YubiKey into your computer&#8217;s USB port and after it starts blinking, tap it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-neo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey NEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is our mobile-friendly device that is equipped with near field communication (NFC). This works by just tapping the YubiKey NEO to the back of your phone. However, Twitter does not yet have support for the YubiKey in their mobile app, but we hope that this will be a feature they add in the near future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey is great for protecting against remote hackers trying to access your account, but you may be thinking, “What if I forget my key?” Twitter has it set up for you to have a backup form of two-factor authentication on your account as well. For example, you could use Google Authenticator or our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/yubico-authenticator/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Authenticator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app to set up your backup on a second YubiKey. These forms of authentication will also be useful for mobile users. That way, you can use a YubiKey on your computer and an authenticator app for your phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best practice is to have multiple YubiKeys set up for your accounts. One on your keychain, or one in your wallet, or one in a safe place at home will help to make sure you’ve always got a backup YubiKey nearby. Many services let users set up multiple YubiKeys with their account for this very reason. Twitter only allows one key at the moment. If you want more than one YubiKey on your Twitter account, or would like to have YubiKey support on mobile, help us out by </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2L7qpLX"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sending a tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to tell them what you’d like to see. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best features of the YubiKey is that you can use just one key for any number of services and accounts. Here are the instructions on how to quickly get your other accounts secured with a YubiKey:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><b>Google: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun fact. Google was the first web service to support the use of U2F and YubiKeys. See how to get started with Google and the YubiKey </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6103521&amp;visit_id=1-636669498874931331-3485186038&amp;rd=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Facebook: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t make the mistake of overlooking the need to protect this social media account. Facebook contains a lot of personally identifiable information that can be used to advance a hacker’s efforts. See how to get started with Facebook and the YubiKey </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/401566786855239"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Dropbox: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re sharing vacation photos or business documents, make sure your files stay safe from prying eyes. See how to get started with Dropbox and YubiKey </span><a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2015/08/u2f-security-keys/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Password Managers: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that the YubiKey works with 17 password managers? See how to get started with your favorite password manager and the YubiKey </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/#password-management"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t see one of your favorites? Don’t worry. We have plenty of other services — for individual users and businesses — that support the YubiKey. You can see the full list </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/#all"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we are excited to announce that Yubico’s CEO and Founder, Stina Ehrensvard, was named </span><a href="http://www.womenworldawards.com/world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Female Executive of the Year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Women World Awards for the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/06/yubico-ceo-wins-female-exec-of-the-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second year in a row</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news comes on the heels of several major announcements that we’ve shared over the past few weeks — </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/05/yubikey-comes-to-iphone-with-mobile-sdk-for-ios-and-lastpass-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey for iOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/06/fips-140-2-validated-yubikey-series/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIPS 140-2 YubiKey Series</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/05/yubico-a16z-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/04/new-security-key-fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 passwordless logins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and we couldn’t be happier to keep the momentum going by celebrating Yubico’s founder and the milestones we’ve achieved together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Women World Awards are an annual industry and peers recognition program honoring women in business and the professions and organizations of all types and sizes from around the world. The program encompasses the world’s best in leadership, innovation, organizational performance, and new products and services from every major industry in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Female Executive of the Year category highlights individual women whose accomplishments in the last year set an impressive standard for the company as well as industry norms. Stina was selected as the Gold Winner in this category due to her significant contributions and innovations to advance the current state of internet security. Most notably, Yubico’s work in developing FIDO2 and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">driving new paths for the next generation of online security: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">passwordless logins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an honor to be named a winner by Women World Awards,” said Stina. “These awards are an encouraging reminder that each year, Yubico is one step closer to seeing our vision of a safer internet for all become a reality. I’m proud of everything the Yubico team has done to get us there, and has been able to accomplish over the last year.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIPS 140-2 is a US government computer security standard, published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), that covers the use of cryptographic functionality such as encryption, authentication, and digital signatures. The FIPS 140-2 validated YubiKeys meet the most stringent security requirements of US federal agencies. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey FIPS series uses the YubiKey 4 Cryptographic Module that received </span><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program/Certificate/3204"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIPS 140-2 validated at Overall Level 2, Physical Security Level 3 with certificate number 3204</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At this level, the YubiKey FIPS series meets Authenticator Assurance Level 3 (AAL3) as defined in </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/06/nist-publishes-sp800-63-3-fido-u2f-achieves-aal3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIST SP800-63B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that enables compliance with Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)  and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIPS certification is essential for many branches of the US government and contractors, in addition to those in the private sector that collect and transmit sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey FIPS Series hardware authentication devices include keychain and nano form-factors for USB-A and USB-C interfaces. The YubiKey FIPS Series is the only FIPS validated multi-protocol security key in the market supporting five authentication protocols; FIDO U2F, smart card (PIV), Yubico OTP, OpenPGP, and OATH-HOTP/TOTP.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, federal entities and federal-compliant enterprises can comply with the high assurance security requirements for on-premise or cloud deployments using the YubiKey FIPS Series. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies including Google, Facebook, Salesforce and thousands more trust the YubiKey to protect account access to computers, networks and online services. Now, we are able to deliver the same simple, trusted protection as a FIPS validated solution. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authored by Venkat Venkataraju &amp; Jesper Johansson </span></em></p>
<p><em><b>Yubico Blog Update and Statement &#8211; 6/18/18</b></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 13, 2018 we published this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog post</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2018-02/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security advisory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding WebUSB issues in Chrome. In hindsight we realize that we did not give enough credit in our blog post and security advisory to the foundational work done by Markus Vervier and Michele Orrù, who highlighted and demonstrated the first security vulnerability in WebUSB at </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUa6nWWTO4o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OffensiveCon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and which was subsequently written up in a </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-yubikey-phishing-webusb/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WIRED article.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After posting, we communicated with them, apologized for this, and made updates to the blog post and security advisory to make sure proper credit was given. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building on the publicly available information about work by Markus and Michele described in the article, Yubico investigated the issue and developed our own proof of concept (PoC) test tools. In the process we discovered additional issues with WebUSB and began outreach with Google on March 1st. Yubico first spoke with the researchers on March 2nd. The formal </span><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=818592"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bug report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which Yubico submitted to Google on March 5th, referenced the OffensiveCon talk by Markus and Michele and their original public announcement of the CCID issue in the first sentence. We submitted this privately to protect our customers and the broader U2F ecosystem. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markus and Michele’s research provided a critical foundation, and we made a mistake by not clearly acknowledging them for their original research in our security advisory. We learned only on June 13, after we published our advisory, that Markus and Michele also discovered and reported HID issues to Google. We understand that better communication after the issue was fixed would have ensured that all parties were in sync, and will use this as an opportunity for improvement.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico has always strived to be transparent and we regret the missed opportunity to work more collaboratively with Markus and Michele. Historically, Yubico has worked closely with security researchers across the globe and we are committed to continue to do so.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-end update&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve the entire security ecosystem, Yubico is a strong believer in responsible disclosure practices. We believe that the best outcome happens when security researchers  confidentially provide research and reporting to an impacted company, so a fix can be in place before any public disclosure to help protect users from the exploitation of the vulnerability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Yubico worked with Google under responsible disclosure to address WebUSB vulnerabilies in Google Chrome that affected the entire ecosystem of FIDO U2F authenticators, manufactured by Yubico and well as other vendors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original issue first surfaced in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chrome-yubikey-phishing-webusb/">news article</a> in March 2018 describing how security researchers Markus Vervier and Michele Orrù had <a href="https://www.offensivecon.org/speakers/2018/markus-and-michele.html">demonstrated</a> how to circumvent the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO U2F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> origin check using WebUSB functionality in Google Chrome and the YubiKey NEO&#8217;s USB CCID U2F interface. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Yubico was informed of the CCID issue, our own researchers quickly discovered there was a broader set of security concerns within WebUSB that affected the entire ecosystem of FIDO U2F authenticators. To help protect the U2F ecosystem, we <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=818592">disclosed these issues to Google</a> in early March and worked closely with their engineering teams on a mitigation plan to address this issue and secure all U2F customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the May 29, 2018 release of Chrome 67, Google fixed the WebUSB vulnerability and the issue could no longer affect any (Yubico or other) U2F authenticators. To read the detailed report of the WebUSB issue in Chrome, please visit our </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/security"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Advisories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page for </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2018-02/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this research and disclosure, Google awarded Yubico a bug bounty in the amount of $5,000, which Yubico has opted to donate to charity. Yubico chose </span><a href="https://girlswhocode.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Girls Who Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a non-profit that aims to support and increase the number of women in computer science. Additionally, Google has matched the donation with another $5,000, resulting in a $10,000 donation to Girls Who Code, to further support efforts at increasing diversity in our field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security ecosystem is only as strong as the weakest link and if we, as a community of vendors and security researchers effectively and respectfully work together, we can secure not only end users, but the entire ecosystem from continually evolving threats.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the protection of everyone, we encourage all researchers to responsibly disclose any discovered security concerns to the affected company so they may implement a fix before any public disclosure. To contact the security team at Yubico please email <a href="mailto:security@yubico.com">security@yubico.com</a>.</span></p>
<p><b><br />
<em>June 13th Update:</em></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We were just made aware that the original researchers reported the Windows HID issue to Google around the same time we submitted it to Google. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were not aware of this at the time, we independently discovered it while investigating the public CCID issue,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and followed standard responsible disclosure practices by sending all our findings, including the Windows HID issue, only to the affected vendor in order to afford maximum protection for the ecosystem. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re gearing up for Europe’s biggest information security event of the year: InfoSecurity Europe 2018. Following our announcement with Microsoft at RSA 2018, we’re excited to showcase in Europe the new use cases made possible by the FIDO2 standard, including passwordless single factor, second factor and multi-factor authentication. Come see the new Security Key by Yubico in action at booth J120 at Olympia London from June 5 to 7. Yubico will be demonstrating <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/04/yubico-and-microsoft-introduce-passwordless-login/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passwordless login on Windows 10</a> and the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/05/yubikey-comes-to-iphone-with-mobile-sdk-for-ios-and-lastpass-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest iOS mobile offering with LastPass</a>.</p>
<p>Along with the recent announcement of our new FIDO2-enabled security key, we introduced a new Yubico Developer Program with a FIDO2 track. InfoSecurity Europe attendees (and those who are reading this blog) can sign up for early access to resources to support implementation of FIDO2, including the first How-to FIDO2 webinar scheduled for June 14.</p>
<p>Also, joining us in the exhibit hall are five Yubico Technology Partners. Stop by the Yubico booth to learn about these valuable partnerships. We also encourage you to visit their booths, see what they have to offer, and the integration of the YubiKey with their services!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Yubico is proud to announce its latest round of investment from </span><a href="https://a16z.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a16z). a16z is supporting Yubico’s mission to create a safer internet for everyone by providing ubiquitous secure access to computers, networks and servers. The company has been growing with profits over the last six years, and funds from the new investment will be used for scaling engineering, product and development teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to company backing, Martin Casado, general partner for a16z, will be <a href="http://a16z.com/2018/05/31/yubico/">joining the Yubico board of directors</a>. With an extensive background in computer science, software-defined networking, and security, Martin will support the company in a rapid growth phase. Helping Yubico scale as the hardware root of trust for users and servers, as we move toward the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passwordless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> future.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Internet security is an area I’m personally very passionate about and I’m a true believer in the Yubico vision and approach. I’m thrilled to be joining the board and working with the team on this journey forward,” said Casado.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey is the authenticator of choice for thousands of business customers and millions of users in more than 160 countries, including a16z, who currently deploy YubiKeys to every employee. This decision was made prior to the investment in Yubico, as a16z determined that the YubiKey was the most secure approach for protecting accounts and sensitive company data.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico CEO and Founder Stina Ehrensvard worked with Martin Casado on the a16z Podcast episode ‘</span><a href="https://a16z.com/2018/02/27/state-of-security-summit-2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State of Security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ from earlier this year to provide insight into the crossroads of software and hardware in the security space. Specifically, Stina spoke about the increasingly important role of authentication  in a world where we hear of new data breaches and stolen user credentials on a daily basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous Yubico investors include </span><a href="http://www.nea.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and renowned Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, and Ram Shriram, Yubico Chairman and Google founding board member.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, open authentication standards reached an important milestone; </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/04/yubico-and-microsoft-introduce-passwordless-login/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support for FIDO2 and CTAP, and the </span><a href="http://www.w3c.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Wide Web Consortium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (W3C) won approval for WebAuthn. Since then, Yubico has received questions on how these efforts are related, what role FIDO U2F and Yubico have in the mix, and what organizations can implement now — and in the future — to enable simple, strong authentication for employees and end-users. This blog will bring some clarity to those questions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><b>What is the difference between FIDO U2F and FIDO2?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U2F was developed by Yubico and Google, and contributed to the FIDO Alliance after it was successfully deployed for Google employees. The protocol is designed to act as a second factor to strengthen existing username/password-based login flows. It’s built on Yubico’s invention of a scalable public-key model in which a new key pair is generated for each service and an unlimited number of services can be supported, all while maintaining full separation between them to preserve privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, FIDO2 is the passwordless evolution of FIDO U2F. The overall objective for FIDO2 is to provide an extended set of functionality to cover additional use-cases, with the main driver being passwordless login flows. The U2F model is still the basis for FIDO2 and compatibility for existing U2F deployments is provided in the FIDO2 specs.</span></p>
<p><b></b><b>What is WebAuthn &amp; CTAP?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new, extensible web authentication API, called Webauthn, has been developed within W3C, which supports both existing FIDO U2F and upcoming FIDO2 credentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FIDO U2F client-side protocol has been renamed CTAP1, and a new, extensible client-to-authenticator protocol (CTAP2) has been developed to allow for external authenticators (tokens, phones, smart cards etc.) to interface with FIDO2-enabled browsers and Operating Systems </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAuthn and CTAP2 are both required to deliver the FIDO2 passwordless login experience, but WebAuthn still supports FIDO U2F authenticators, since CTAP1 is also part of the WebAuthn specification.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><b></b></p>
<p><b>How can organizations deploy FIDO2?</b><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can organizations do if they are aiming to provide support for FIDO2? We recommend making support for WebAuthn as it works with existing FIDO U2F authenticators and also FIDO 2 authenticators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla Firefox 60 recently </span><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/05/09/firefox-gets-down-to-business-and-its-personal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">added support for WebAuthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Chrome 67 will be shipping with WebAuthn support in the near future, and Microsoft has already announced they will support WebAuthn in Edge browsers. The U2F web API continues to work for U2F authenticators, but is limited to the Chrome and Opera browsers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To evaluate WebAuthn with FIDO U2F and FIDO2 authenticators today, Yubico offers a test service at </span><a href="https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demo.yubico.com/webauthn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and soon we will provide more complete open source FIDO2 servers on GitHub. Organizations can sign up for updates from the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Developer Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get information on FIDO2 and WebAuthn resources. </span><b></b></p>
<p><b>So, what’s our role in all of this? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Yubico’s perspective, we’re proud and pleased to see our vision of one single security key to any number of services become a reality. We’ve watched this vision progress from our launch of the first YubiKey in 2008, to early U2F development in 2011, to the launch of FIDO2 in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With WebAuthn providing a seamless evolution from U2F to FIDO2, and with upcoming support for built-in authenticators and additional use-cases, WebAuthn becomes the center of a ubiquitous ecosystem for authentication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission has always been to drive standards and adoption by providing technical specifications, open source components, and developer tools; and to be the gold standard for authenticators. With the open standards ecosystem growing, we see the vision of providing strong authentication for everyone coming true. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a question that we receive often, ‘so how does the YubiKey work with iPhone?’ Until now, the answer to that question has been a bit unclear because of limited support for NFC in iOS. But today, we have a clear answer: YubiKey iOS support is here, now, with two exciting pieces of news.</p>
<p>For application developers, we are introducing a new Mobile SDK for iOS that allows any iOS mobile app to rapidly add support for hardware-based two-factor authentication (2FA) using YubiKey OTP over NFC. Second, LastPass, one of our longest and most prominent integrations, has released the latest version of its password management app with fully integrated support for the YubiKey NEO over NFC on iOS. This was completed using our Mobile SDK for iOS, but we’ll share more on this milestone a little later.</p>
<div id="attachment_350698" style="width: 1040px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-350698" class="wp-image-350698 size-large" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lp2-1030x687.jpg" alt="" width="1030" height="687" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lp2-1030x687.jpg 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lp2-444x296.jpg 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lp2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lp2-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lp2-705x470.jpg 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lp2-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1030px) 100vw, 1030px" /><p id="caption-attachment-350698" class="wp-caption-text">A user authenticates to their LastPass app on iPhone using a YubiKey NEO over near field communication (NFC).</p></div>
<p>The launch of iOS 11 last year saw Apple provide support for NFC tag reading, which allowed developers to build apps with one-time passcode (OTP) support. Given that the YubiKey NEO can generate an OTP and send it to the requesting app via NFC, it became possible to authenticate with Yubico one-time password (Yubico OTP) with a YubiKey NEO &#8212; a feature requested by many YubiKey users. However, documentation and reference code for developers to add this support to applications was lacking and unnecessarily complicated.</p>
<p>To help mobile application developers simplify rollouts and deliver on this functionality, Yubico created the Mobile SDK for iOS. It’s available now <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/">for download</a> and is also part of the Yubico Developer Program mobile track, and provides developers all the necessary tools to rapidly up-level their iOS mobile app security with Yubico OTP.</p>
<p>By introducing YubiKey hardware-based authentication via NFC to iPhone applications, users no longer need to toggle between apps and temporarily memorize a throw away code before it expires. Now users can just tap the YubiKey to authenticate, which is four times faster than typing in an OTP! Not to mention, users and app developers no longer have to run the risk of potential security and reliability issues by relying on SMS or mobile authentication.</p>
<p><strong>LastPass iOS App Supports Yubico OTP via NFC</strong><br />
The LastPass password manager remains one of the most popular YubiKey integrations for Yubico OTP, and the application has supported NFC on Android devices <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2012/03/introducing-lastpass-mobile-support-for-the-yubikey-neo.html/">for many years</a>.</p>
<p>Today, LastPass is the very first password manager application on iOS to enhance its security with Yubico OTP authentication through NFC. This means that LastPass users with iPhone 7 or above, running iOS 11 and above, can now authenticate to their LastPass Premium, Families, Teams, or Enterprise accounts on their mobile device with the same YubiKey NEO that they use for their desktop or laptop. Users will touch the YubiKey NEO to the iPhone to wirelessly transfer a Yubico OTP and securely authenticate to the application</p>
<p>“LastPass has long supported YubiKey as a multi-factor authentication option for adding an extra layer of security to LastPass accounts and values the partnership we have with the Yubico team,” said Akos Putz, Principal Product Manager for LastPass at LogMeIn. “With the new mobile SDK for iOS, our customers now benefit from the strength and security of hardware-backed YubiKey 2FA with the support for our iOS app.”</p>
<p>For current LastPass users, the iOS application will receive an automatic update (version 4.2.7) via the App Store and you can set up YubiKey in your account settings. If you’re an iPhone user, you can download the latest version of LastPass <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id324613447">here</a> and for further instructions on setup, visit <a href="https://yubico.com/lastpass">here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CNpsqEjcJRI" width="780" height="424" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>We applaud LastPass for supporting this milestone leap in YubiKey mobile app authentication for iPhones and iOS. With this announcement, the YubiKey now provides simple and secure authentication <a href="https://yubico.com/products/yubikey-for-mobile/">for all leading mobile platforms</a> including Android, Windows mobile, and iOS. Find out more about our new Mobile SDK for iOS <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few months, Yubico has been working closely with the U.S. National Institute of Standards (NIST) National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) to improve mobile authentication methods for public safety professionals and first responders. Today, we’re happy to share that this guidance is now available in the form of a three-volume draft practice guide: </span><a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/publication/1800-13/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIST Special Publication 1800-13, Mobile Application Single Sign-On: Improving Authentication for Public Safety and First Responders.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This has been an important project for Yubico and the NCCoE as simple, secure access to critical data can often be a matter of life or death in an emergency response scenario. In high-alert situations, first responder and public safety personnel are often dispatched in the field and are heavily reliant on mobile platforms to access data in real-time that’s needed to deliver proper care. This data may include personally identifiable information (PII), law enforcement sensitive information, or protected health information (PHI), and it is imperative that access to this type of information is highly protected. However, complex and cumbersome authentication requirements to access sensitive information that cause even the slightest of delays in the emergency response process, can potentially risk the life of an individual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To mitigate the security and access challenges for public safety and first responder personnel, the NCCoE collaborated with several technology vendors, including Yubico, to develop mobile authentication requirements and implement a reference design that assembles commercially available technologies that support the following open standards: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments </span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(RFC) 8252, OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO Universal Second Factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FIDO U2F) and Universal Authentication Framework (FIDO UAF)</span></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.oasis-open.org/security/FrontPage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0</span></a></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenID Connect </span><a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(OIDC) 1.0</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico was a core contributor to this process. The reference implementation, which is documented in the practice guide, uses the NFC-enabled YubiKey (</span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-neo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey NEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) in combination with Federation technology OpenID Connect to strongly secure user access to sensitive applications, improve usability and efficiency of user account management, and share identities across organizational boundaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was recognized early on in the project that reliance on passwords alone can expand the scope of a single data compromise from one service to multiple services due to password reuse. The use of FIDO U2F for authentication provides protection beyond the password, and eliminates problems with social engineering, man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, and phishing, which all present real threats to password-based and OTP-based (SMS, mobile push) authentication systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following diagram from the NCCoE practice guide illustrates the recommended authentication flow for a native app on an Android device using standards-based technologies such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect / SAML, and FIDO U2F with the YubiKey as the trusted second factor.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-349132 aligncenter" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2-444x500.png" alt="" width="444" height="500" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2-444x500.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2-768x865.png 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2-914x1030.png 914w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2-1331x1500.png 1331w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2-626x705.png 626w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2-450x507.png 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2.png 1774w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OAuth 2.0 for native apps specification requires that applications use a system browser for making authorization requests. This allows a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider, such as Motorola Solutions or GIS, to redirect authentication back to the user’s agency or enterprise via a standard authentication protocol such as OpenID Connect or SAML.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the system browser also enables the built-in operating system (OS) support for FIDO U2F authentication to be used without requiring special support in the native apps. This allows a generic SaaS application to support thousands of different identity providers, and different types of external FIDO U2F multi-factor authenticators (like the YubiKey) within a single native application. This avoids having to customize native apps for each organization and instead, allows the reuse of generic components that can make these systems available to even the smallest of organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of FIDO, OAuth, and SAML/OpenID Connect has been shown to be a robust and flexible solution for public safety use cases. In fact, one of the collaborators in the practice guide, Motorola Solutions, has incorporated this model into their commercial product </span><a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/my-software/psxcockpit.html#taboverview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PSX Cocpit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is currently being deployed in a number of verticals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an end user perspective, these standards-based technologies are delivering a simple touch-and-go experience while maintaining the highest levels of security. To access sensitive data within a mobile application, first responder personnel will only require an NFC- and FIDO U2F-enabled hardware authentication device such as the YubiKey NEO. By simply touching the device to their phone, they will be securely authenticated to the app within seconds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This particular project with NCCoE targets a first-responders use case, however the practice guide is equally applicable to many enterprise mobile scenarios. For more information on the project and to download the Mobile Application Single Sign-On practice guide, please visit the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) </span><a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use-cases/mobile-sso"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The NCCoE is also </span><a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/webform/comments-sp-1800-13-mobile-application-single-sign"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accepting public comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the guide until June 18, 2018. </span></p>

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago, at the 2008 RSA Conference, Yubico launched the first YubiKey with the goal of making secure login easy and accessible for everyone.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The vision was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one single security key to work across any number of services, with great user experience, security, and privacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On this anniversary, Yubico has taken another major leap forward toward this vision with the announcement that the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2018/04/new-security-key-fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently-launched Security Key by Yubico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with FIDO2, will be supported in Windows 10 devices and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The feature is currently in limited preview for Microsoft Technology Adoption Program (TAP) customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 is the passwordless evolution of the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard, created by Yubico and Google. While U2F included a username and password, FIDO2 supports more use cases, including <a href="https://www.yubico.com/go-passwordless/" target="_blank">passwordless authentication</a>. Yubico has worked in close collaboration with Microsoft on developing the FIDO2 technical specifications, and the Security Key by Yubico is the first FIDO2 authentication device on the market.</span></p>
<p><b>What Does This Mean? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations will soon have the option to enable employees and customers to sign in to an Azure AD joined device with no password, by simply using a Security Key to get single sign-on to all Azure AD based applications and services. This is just the beginning; Google and Mozilla also announced </span><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-and-w3c-achieve-major-standards-milestone-in-global-effort-towards-simpler-stronger-authentication-on-the-web/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chrome and Firefox support for the Web Authentication API (WebAuthn)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed by Yubico and members of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and included in the FIDO2 specification. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wl479T2t6eo" width="780" height="428" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><b>Why Is This Important? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly every digital experience today requires passwords, an increasingly frustrating fact of life for businesses and users. For any one person there can be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of sites and devices &#8212; both personal and business related &#8212; that require memorized passwords. This leads to poor password hygiene: shared and reused passwords. And it is a real cost for businesses managing, storing and resetting passwords for employees and end-users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working in conjunction with Windows and Microsoft cloud services, the new Security Key by Yubico offers a secure, seamless and passwordless login experience with one of the world’s largest computer operating systems. Use cases include retail, healthcare, transportation, finance, manufacturing, and more. </span></p>
<p><b></b><b>How Does It Work? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 is built on the same security and privacy features of FIDO U2F: strong public key cryptography, no drivers or client software and one key for unlimited account access with no shared secrets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With FIDO U2F, the user entered a username and password, inserted a  security key in the USB-port, and touched the gold area. F</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IDO2 adds more options to the login process: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Single Factor: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This only requires possession of the Security Key to log in, allowing for a passwordless tap-and-go experience. </span></li>
<li><b>Second-Factor:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In a two-factor authentication scenario, such as the current Google and Facebook FIDO U2F implementations, the Security Key by Yubico is used as a strong second factor along with a username and password. </span></li>
<li><b>Multi-Factor:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This allows the use of the Security Key by Yubico with an additional factor such as a PIN (instead of a password), to meet the high-assurance requirements of  operations like financial transactions, or submitting a prescription.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Who Can Get Involved?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone is encouraged to get involved, and accelerate progress to a secure and passwordless world. As with any open standard, advancement will be a collective industry effort and a process of global adoption. Yubico helped the majority of services in making support for FIDO U2F by providing open source code and support. Together with </span><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-and-w3c-achieve-major-standards-milestone-in-global-effort-towards-simpler-stronger-authentication-on-the-web/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">W3C and FIDO Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have made the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2 open authentication standard available, and we are helping </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">support its rapid integration into services and applications through our new </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Developer Program.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading to RSA in San Francisco next week? We’ll be there too, celebrating our 10th year at the conference! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to stop by Booth #S2241 to see all the awesome things we will be showing, and if you haven’t registered for the conference yet, use this code (</span><b><i>X8EYUBIC) </i></b><a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/events/us18/register"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a free expo pass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on us.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An industry first, we are showcasing passwordless login with the just released </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security Key by Yubico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the first hardware authentication device to support both </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO U2F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yubico is a leading contributor to the new FIDO2 open authentication standard which shares many of the same characteristics as FIDO U2F: public key cryptography, no shared secrets, and no drivers or client software. However, with FIDO2, there’s no need for passwords as user credentials are tied directly to the Security Key. The device can also be conveniently paired with PINs, biometrics, or other human gestures as an additional factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Yubico we’re constantly innovating to make simple, secure authentication a standard for the industry. Along with the announcement of our new FIDO2-enabled security key, we are also announcing our new </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico Developer Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide resources for rapidly enabling strong authentication in web and mobile applications across all our supported protocols including FIDO U2F, PIV (smart card), OpenPGP, OTP (one-time password), the new FIDO2 protocol and for the YubiHSM2. Developer resources include workshops, webinars, implementation guides, reference code, APIs and SDKs. RSA attendees (and those who are reading this blog) will be able to sign up for early access to resources to support implementation of FIDO2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also invite you to join our CEO &amp; Founder, Stina Ehrensvärd, and SVP of Product, Jerrod Chong, who will be speaking on the importance of strong authentication for today and tomorrow’s cyber landscape. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are driving on highway 101 between Palo Alto and San Francisco in the coming couple of weeks, you may come across a billboard with a diver holding up a YubiKey. The same diver also appears on our website homepage. The photo was shot by Alessio, principal engineer at Yubico, from his adventure under 20 meters of water in the Philippines. </p>
<p>The same image inspired Josh, web developer at Yubico, to try logging into his email underwater with a waterproof phone and YubiKey. And yes, it worked! Please check out the short video below that Josh and other members of our team just created. </p>
<p>At Yubico, we highly regard our adventurous and multi-talented engineers. Last year, we doubled our engineering team in Stockholm, Palo Alto and Seattle. This year we are doubling again. If you are a software or hardware engineer who wants to make the internet safer for everyone &#8211; on land or underwater &#8211; we welcome you to apply for our <a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/careers/">open job positions</a>!  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<section class="av_textblock_section"  itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost" ><div class='avia_textblock '   itemprop="text" ><p>Today, together with the FIDO Alliance, we made a big announcement that paves the way to a passwordless future. We revealed the new Security Key by Yubico as well as our new Developer Program, both of which support the new FIDO2 open standard for passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Think of a time when you have created a new account <em>and didn’t have to create a new password.</em></p>
<p>For all of us, the account creation process for any application or online service has always started with the pairing of a password to your username, but with today’s announcement that is going to change. With FIDO2, it’s now possible to redesign the process to remove the weak link of passwords, and we’re gearing up to support the ecosystem and developer community to make that happen. Whether you’ve followed Yubico for years, or you’re just learning about us, read ahead to find out more about the significance of the FIDO2 project.</p>
<h2> The FIDO2 Project</h2>
<p>In 2011, Yubico invented the concept of a single security key to protect user accounts from phishing and unauthorized access, for any number of services with no shared secrets. We worked with Google to further develop this concept to what today is the FIDO U2F standard.</p>
<p>Now, Yubico has worked in collaboration with Microsoft on the evolution of the FIDO U2F authentication standard, to create FIDO2. With FIDO2, the Security Key with its strong authentication can now solve multiple use case scenarios and experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>— second factor in a two factor authentication solution</li>
<li>— strong first factor, with the possession of the device only, allowing for a passwordless experience like tap and go</li>
<li>— multi-factor with possession of the device AND PIN, to solve high assurance requirements such as financial transactions, or submitting a prescription.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FIDO2-Image-2.png" alt="Capabilities enabled by the FIDO2 project" /></p>
<p>FIDO2 has already received support from the FIDO Alliance, <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, and all major web browsers to aid in its global standardization and adoption. With this foundation, FIDO2 is positioned to help services, applications, and enterprise organizations seamlessly transition to a more secure, easy to use replacement for the static password.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about FIDO2 here</a>. If you’re interested in developing with this new standard, you’ll need a Security Key by Yubico and we encourage you to sign up for FIDO2 updates as part of our newly announced <a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yubico Developer Program</a>.</p>
<h2><em>NEW</em>  Security Key by Yubico</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-279512 size-medium" style="width: 40%;" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-444x444.png" alt="" width="444" height="444" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-444x444.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-80x80.png 80w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-768x768.png 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-36x36.png 36w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-180x180.png 180w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-705x705.png 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-120x120.png 120w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-720x720.png 720w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico-450x450.png 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Security-Key-by-Yubico.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></p>
<p>The Security Key by Yubico delivers FIDO2 and FIDO U2F in a single device, supporting existing U2F two-factor authentication (2FA) as well as FIDO2 implementations.</p>
<p>The new Security Key by Yubico supports both the Web Authentication (WebAuthn) API, and Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP) which are required for FIDO2-based authentication.</p>
<p>FIDO2 and the Security Key are delivering on trusted, touch-and-go authentication for the modern, flexible and mobile workforce that is meeting the needs of our on-demand society. Together, these technologies will be integrated into many verticals including: retail, healthcare, transportation, finance, manufacturing, and more.</p>
<p>We will be demonstrating the new Security Key by Yubico and new FIDO2 functionality at the RSA South Expo hall at Booth #2241. You can purchase one up from our webstore today ($20 USD). <a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/security-key-by-yubico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about the Security Key by Yubico here</a>.</p>
<h2><em> NEW</em>  Yubico Developer Program</h2>
<p>This year marks the 10 year anniversary of the launch of the first YubiKey, that millions of users in more than 160 countries around the world love for its ease of use, security, and affordability. We made our YubiKeys available with free open source servers that encouraged adoption and growth of a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thriving ecosystem of services supporting our technology</a>. We’ve learned a lot from our partnerships, which is why we today announced a formalized Developer Program. This provides developers with the resources to rapidly integrate the YubiKey with mobile and computer login, across all our supported protocols including U2F, Yubico OTP, PIV-compatible Smart Card, OpenPGP, OATH (HOTP/TOTP), and the new FIDO2 <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20170927/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20170927.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> specification, and the YubiHSM.</p>
<p>We encourage developers and security architects interested in FIDO2 to sign up for updates as part of the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-developers/developer-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yubico Developer Program</a>, to get access to resources needed to aid in early implementations of the FIDO2 open authentication standard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, both the public and private sector have faced similar challenges when securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) of their information systems. Older technologies and policies have historically conflicted with business/organizational objectives when striving for high security. Today, advancements in cryptography and the adoption of newer, improved open standards are eliminating usability issues, and reducing help desk costs through fewer forgotten passwords. We like to call that modernization.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/i-think-therefore-iam/announcing-draft-special-publication-800-63-3-digital-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than a year ago</a>, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began the process of updating their SP 800-63 <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Identity Guidelines</a>. These much needed changes enable federal agencies and contractors to leverage more convenient and secure authentication methods while still maintaining highest security. As a result, the cybersecurity team’s efforts to comply with federal guidelines can now more easily align with the rest of the industry-evolving technologies already embraced in the private sector.</p>
<p>At Yubico, our mission is to make secure online identities ubiquitous by making account security easy to use, secure, and affordable. The YubiKey combines three of NIST’s permitted authentication types—multi-factor crypto device (PIV-compatible/smart card), single-factor crypto device (FIDO U2F), and single-factor OTP device (Yubico OTP and OATH HOTP/TOTP). In addition, the YubiKey is currently <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program/Modules-In-Process/Modules-In-Process-List" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on track</a> to become the first multi-protocol hardware authenticator certified at FIPS 140-2 Overall Level 2 and Physical Level 3.</p>
<p>The modernization of policy by the US federal government presents an opportunity for Yubico and <a href="https://duo.com/partners/technology-partnerships/yubico" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duo Security</a>—both trusted leaders in easy to use, reliable security products—to deliver a unified security platform for government agencies and contractors that meets NIST Authenticator Assurance Levels 2 through 3 (AAL 2 &#8211; AAL3).</p>
<p>We recently sat down with Sean Frazier, Duo Advisory Chief Information Security Officer, Federal during discussions on our joint solution. He shared, “The new authentication and authorization guidance from NIST is giving public sector agencies lots of flexibility to meet their most stringent security needs while providing previously elusive ease of use. In a sector that has been pushing to catch up to other industries in terms of cloud and mobile, the new guidelines are a welcome change for every federal CISO who’s looking to modernize their IT environment. Duo and Yubico combine an easy to use and extremely effective way to achieve the highest levels of assurance for trusted access.”</p>
<p>Duo’s platform enables federal agencies to leverage YubiKey hardware to securely access data and applications on the network or in the cloud. “This federal partnership with Duo underscores our joint commitment to data protection, as well as our responsibility as industry leaders to help federal agencies protect the individuals they serve,” said Jerrod Chong, Yubico SVP of Product. “We’ve made it our shared mission to advocate easy to use security, and encourage the adoption of new open standards like FIDO U2F to meet AAL 3.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domains are a frequent target for phishing attacks that pose serious privacy risks and potential losses of millions of dollars in brand damage, lost revenue, stolen data, and recovery efforts. The threat of phishing greatly underscores the need to protect the front door to your domain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are excited to announce that Gandi is the first domain registrar to integrate support for the YubiKey and </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/for-technology-partners/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO U2F authentication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With this new integration, Gandi customers benefit from greater security to safeguard domains and critical assets, such as SSL certificates, contained within.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey delivers strong defense against phishing at the time of login, complementing Gandi’s promise to provide secure access to domain names, easy third-party integration, and powerful tools for everyone. Gandi is excited to offer users a more secure and easy-to-use 2FA protocol with FIDO U2F, and strongly encourages users to get YubiKeys. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The user-experience was a big factor in our decision to integrate support. The ability to easily manage multiple tokens for multiple users offers a real-world example,” said Andrew Richner, Head of Communication at Gandi US. “The other factor is obviously security. Time-based one-time password (TOTP) has a few weaknesses that the challenge-response of U2F corrects. The resulting difficulty to phish a U2F user makes the YubiKey very attractive as a 2FA option. We love the portability and durability of YubiKeys too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since adopting YubiKey support, Gandi reports that user feedback has been positive. “Our users have come to expect Gandi to be on top of new technology, and to offer a high level of security. We&#8217;re finding that it&#8217;s these customers in particular who are excited to spread the word about using Gandi and YubiKey together,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gandi’s service features easy-to-use domain management tools that enable users to define access rights by organization, team, and individual, as well as delegate domains and hosting to collaborators no matter the organization structure or size. A domain at Gandi comes with a number of free services, including email addresses, http forwarding, an SSL certificate, and domain name system (DNS) management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gandi demonstrates a strong commitment to security and trust—all important values shared by Yubico—that is evident in our joint effort to provide a secure authentication solution to domain management. </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/gandi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about what you can do with Gandi and the YubiKey.</span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing attacks are now considered the main source of data breaches. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>91% of cyber attacks start with a phishing email *</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago, if you asked someone what ‘phishing’ was, they probably would have no idea. Since then, times have changed considerably; phishing attacks are now responsible for a</span><a href="https://digitalguardian.com/blog/91-percent-cyber-attacks-start-phishing-email-heres-how-protect-against-phishing"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> significant number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of </span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/hackers-are-using-ubers-57-million-account-data-breach-to-steal-passwords"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major data breaches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing may have made its way into the mainstream vernacular, but there is still confusion about the subject—and rightfully so. Here&#8217;s a more in-depth look at “<a href="https://www.yubico.com/phishing/">what is phishing?</a>”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and targeted, and even the most tech- or security-savvy people can find themselves a victim. So, how do you make sure you don’t fall victim as well? Use this five-point checklist to closely examine the validity of incoming email. When in doubt, don’t click!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sender </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is your first clue that an email may not be legitimate. Do you know the sender? If not, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">treat the mail with suspicion, and don&#8217;t open any attachments until you verify with the purported sender that they meant to send them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you believe you do know the sender, double check the actual email address. Often, a phishing email will be designed to look like it comes from a person you know, but there will be a slight variation in the address or they will spoof the envelope to show you a name you recognize. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Subject</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay attention to subject lines! While something like, ‘Claim your ultimate deal now!,’ can be an obvious sign of a phishing email, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the far more successful subject lines are the ones that don&#8217;t raise that much suspicion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Account action required’, ‘Delivery status update’, or ‘Billing statement confirmation’ can all be ploys to weaken the email recipient’s defenses through seemingly ordinary alerts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, if something legitimate is that important, your bank, employer, doctor’s office, retailer, or credit card company will find an alternate way to contact you when you’re not responding over email. When in doubt, call to ask if they’ve sent you an email, but do not make that call to a number that was in the email message you are calling about!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Most clicked email phishing subject lines.*</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A delivery attempt was made (18%)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A UPS label delivery  (16%)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Change of password required immediately (15%)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unusual sign-in activity (9%)</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Body</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The body of the email can hold a whole new set of clues, including misspelled words and confusing context. For example, are you asked to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">verify a banking account or login to a financial institution that you don&#8217;t have an account with? Did you get an email from someone you may know that has nothing in it other than a short URL?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Does the content apply to you or make sense based on recent conversations or events? Similarly, if it is a known contact, is there a reason they would be sending you this email? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackers can also use current or popular events to their advantage. For example, holiday shopping, tax season, and natural disaster or tragedy relief efforts are all used to sneak an unsuspecting phishing email into the inbox of thousands of targets. Did you know that the IRS reported a </span><a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/security/taxpayer-beware-email-phishing-scams/L6r4YHSuG"><span style="font-weight: 400;">400 percent increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in phishing scams for the 2016 tax season alone? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How will you know if an email is valid or not? This is where other email clues will come in handy!</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Attachments</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The golden rule &#8212; do NOT open an attachment if any other aspect of the email seems suspicious. Attachments often carry malware and can infect your entire machine. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>7.3% of successful phishing attacks used a link or an attachment</i></b><b><i>**</i></b></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The URLs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to attachments, do NOT click on a link if anything else about the email seems suspicious. This is usually the attacker’s ultimate goal in a phishing scam &#8212; lure users to a malicious site and trick them into entering login credentials or personal information, allowing the attacker full account access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> click on a link, be sure to also verify the actual URL. Are you on Google.com or Go0gle.com? The variations can be slight, but they make all the difference! That said, be aware that a malicious site will not always be visibly reflected in the URL, and therefore you will not be able to tell the difference. If this is the case, most browsers have built-in phishing protection to alert you that something is wrong.  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i>15% of individuals who fall for an initial phishing attack admit to falling for a phishing attack a second time.**</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By using these five email checkpoints, you will be more equipped to decipher a phishing email. However, some phishing attacks are so sophisticated that they can even fool the savviest of users. The good news is that there are technology solutions, such as two-factor authentication, that can help, and we strongly recommend 2FA with the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/">YubiKey</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’d like to get started using a YubiKey, head over to the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/store/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico store </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to shop for the key that suits you best! </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, March 8, Yubico CEO &amp; Founder Stina Ehrensvard was named “The Most Powerful Woman Entrepreneur, 2018” by </span><a href="https://www.va.se/nyheter/2018/03/05/naringslivets-maktigaste-kvinnor-2018-entreprenorerna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veckans Affärer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the leading weekly business magazine in Sweden. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With a product that is becoming a world leading standard, she is today one of Sweden’s most powerful, as well as most successful entrepreneurs,” shared the jury for the award. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the award, </span><a href="https://www.va.se/nyheter/2018/03/02/arets-maktigaste-entreprenorskvinna-min-foraldrar-varnade-mig-aldrig-for-att-klattra-i-trad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veckans Affärer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published a feature on Stina and her story. In the article, Stina thanked her parents for never stopping her from climbing trees as a young girl, and for instead asking how the view was from the top. She also emphasized that the most important foundation in a company is the team and that every award she gets represents Yubico as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Most Powerful Woman Award is celebrating its 20th year anniversary, having started in 1998 to honor and highlight successful, influential women business leaders and entrepreneurs. At the time, there were only 2 women board members for Swedish companies listed on the stock exchange.  Today, the number of women has grown tenfold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The award was handed out at the gala dinner and award ceremony in central Stockholm, attended by leading Swedish business executives.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some cynics say that the problem of internet security will only continue to get worse, and that there is nothing we can do, but manage and minimize damages and losses. As an optimist, I completely disagree. Throughout our existence, people have faced and resolved extremely complex and evolving challenges—a great example of which is automobile safety. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years back, I wrote a blog post entitled </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2013/01/internet-identity-3-point-safety-belt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet Identity and the Safety Belt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It focused on the introduction of the three-point seatbelt and its significant contribution to the automobile industry by making cars safer for drivers and passengers. Today, there are 10 times more cars on the road, but a lower total number of fatal car accidents. While driving will never be completely safe,  millions of lives have been saved through the realization of the problem, innovation, education, market demand, open standards, and government regulations. I am confident that we will make the information superhighway safer for everyone through the same efforts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the automobile industry, the seatbelt is an innovation that has had the greatest positive impact on passenger safety. Further advancements in car safety designs and driver’s education programs have similarly equipped new drivers with the tools they need to safely navigate any unforeseen turns. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if there was a driver’s education program to help internet users move safely across the internet? Perhaps this should become a staple in a school curriculum just like Math and History?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education, innovation, and collaboration are key to helping us all solve this complex challenge together. With that in mind, I am sharing a </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/security-quiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">security quiz </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that we developed for basic IT security training of new Yubico employees. I invite you to test your security knowledge, and please feel free to share the quiz with family, friends, and coworkers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safe driving on the internet!</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the enterprise, smart cards are used to simplify logging into computers, VPNs, and online applications. Smart cards can also be used for digitally signing emails and documents. While smart cards are known for delivering strong authentication, they have not always been known for being the simplest to deploy. For example, to use a smart card in an enterprise setting, an admin needs to install client / driver software on every computer, and an external smart card reader is typically required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2015, the YubiKey has supported smart card PIV functionality with the ability for the YubiKey to act as both a smart card reader and a smart card, meaning that no extra hardware is required</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Most recently, we have simplified smart card deployment with the introduction of a </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/yubikey-smart-card-minidriver-user-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey smart card minidriver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The new YubiKey minidriver enables users to simply self-enroll using the native Windows GUI, and even manage their smart card PIN from Windows Ctrl+Alt+Del. Administrators also benefit from the YubiKey minidriver by being able to do user provisioning using the Microsoft built-in MMC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart card functionality is one of the five authentication protocols supported by the YubiKey, including Yubico and OATH one time password, FIDO U2F, and Open PGP smart card. With this multi-protocol support, the YubiKey is suitable for deployment across the enterprise to secure access to computers, networks, and services. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the World’s Largest Developer Expo + Conference, </span><a href="http://www.developerweek.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeveloperWeek 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, opens at the Oakland Convention Center with thousands of developers participating from all over the globe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a warm up for the conference, hundreds of developers participated in the DevWeek 2018’s hackathon and pulled an all-nighter on Saturday. Over 160 teams coded and collaborated for 24 hours. Our challenge was simple &#8211; incorporate YubiKey two-factor authentication (2FA) support into a standalone project for the chance to win a YubiCrown.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the winning project is&#8230; PetitionThat</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.petitionthat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PetitionThat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a proof of concept that enables petition organizers to collect personal contact information about supporters for the purpose of continued outreach via text, phone, and email after the petition is signed. The platform’s inventors are siblings Solaman and Jameela, and their longtime friend Neil. The three Software Engineers joined forces to tackle an idea they’d been kicking around for awhile. They said, “it’s hard to find time to start a new project. When we saw the tools and technologies that were being promoted for the hackathon and how well they could service our idea, we knew that this was finally the time to build it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were blown away by the progress the team made in just 24 hours. They successfully demonstrated secure login to the PetitionThat organizer platform using the YubiKey, real-time signing of a petition by a verified citizen, and re-engagement with the petition-signer over SMS. What really stood out, however, was this team’s fundamental understanding of the importance of privacy and security of the data they aim to collect. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what they have to say</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the current political climate, too many people feel like they don’t have a voice. They wish they could improve some aspect of society, but they don’t really feel empowered to inspire change. People have traditionally proven support for an idea by gathering signatures, and today, there are petition websites that go further by leveraging the reach and connectedness of the internet. However, the problem with these sites is that there’s no verification of supporters. It’s too easy for petition organizers and supporters alike to game the system, creating a lack of confidence in the actual support for an idea,” shared the PetitionThat team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PetitionThat solves this problem by filtering submissions that appear to be fraudulent and requiring a verified electronic signature for an individual to be counted among the supporters of a cause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our service requires two-factor authentication from petition organizers before they can access the contact information of their supporters. We can associate a YubiKey with their account to make two-factor authentication as easy as pressing a button,” they said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The YubiKey gives us confidence that a petition organizer’s account isn’t being accessed by a malicious third party to collect personal contact information about supporters for a cause. And for organizers, it’s easier to use than other two-factor authentication methods, such as taking out a phone, waiting for a text message, and manually typing in a code. We get the security of two-factor authentication in a way that doesn’t slow down our users when they’re logging in.&#8221;<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the experience of developing with and using the YubiKey and our developer tools, they said, “We explored a lot of new technologies when working on this project, including the YubiKey. The service advertises integration in less than an hour; </span><b>it took us 15 minutes!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was so easy! There were some APIs from other hackathon sponsors that were so complicated or poorly documented that we had to re-architect our service to avoid using them. The YubiKey and YubiCloud just integrated seamlessly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico applauds PetitionThat for their vision, hard work, and excellent performance at the DevWeek hackathon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A journalist recently asked me why the world is seeing the return of hardware authentication. My response is that hardware actually never went away. Today, there is no more prevalent form of user verification than hardware. If there had been an easier and more secure way to deploy and revoke user credentials for billions of people, we would not have hardware SIM cards in our phones or chip credit cards in our wallets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is all about minimizing attack surface and achieving separation. The recent Spectre and Meltdown attacks illustrated that it’s hard to achieve watertight separation between processes as systems become increasingly complex. General purpose computing devices that are connected to the internet have big attack surfaces, making them vulnerable to attacks from many fronts, including malware, phishing, malicious apps, Wifi exploits, VPN masking, and social engineering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, hardware security devices by themselves do not automatically make things more secure. Modern threats require stronger cryptography with a tighter integration to the applications they’re designed to protect. As a result, we will see increased awareness and adoption of hardware-based authentication and encryption devices using public key cryptography throughout 2018. These devices keep cryptographic information physically separated from the computing device they are connected to, dramatically minimizing the attack surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of using hardware authenticators go beyond just security. Users wanting to ensure privacy do not want to leave footprints that tie their identity to a particular device. Most mobile devices are controlled or monitored by the telecom or platform providers, collecting data about user activities. Furthermore, tying user identity to a device does not easily allow for multiple identities, such as separate identities for work and personal accounts, or being anonymous. Hardware authenticators, such as the YubiKey, do not require you to share any personal details of yourself to authenticate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, there are enterprises who do not allow their employees to bring their phones to work, which makes mobile device based authentication inaccessible. In some geographic locations, there are regulations in place that prohibit companies from forcing employees to download business applications on personal computing devices.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobility is another important benefit of hardware-based authenticators. With your credentials tied to an integrated device, it can be difficult to move your login credentials between devices, as there is no seamless communication standard between all computers and mobile platform. Using a hardware authenticator with multiple communication methods solves this problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, hardware authenticators offer significant benefits related to backups. Independent of what type of authentication technology selected, users will sooner or later lose, break, or reset their login devices. When organizations allow the use of multiple affordable hardware authenticators, one as a primary and others as backups, productive work will increase and support calls will decrease. A hardware authenticator, such as the YubiKey, can cost less than a support call, and a fraction of the expense of using a mobile phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, in 2018, Yubico and all leading browsers and platform providers are engaged in open standards work based on hardware and public key crypto across leading standards organizations, including the FIDO Alliance, W3C, IETF, and OpenID. We work together not as competitors, but as true leaders collaboratively driving the open standards that will stop the number one problem of IT security breaches for login, payments, IoT, and beyond: stolen user credentials.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we are proud to announce that Yubico CEO &amp; Founder, Stina Ehrensvard, won the national finals for Ernst &amp; Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year, earning her the title of Female Shooting Star, Sweden. This follows her acceptance of the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/11/yubico-ceo-awarded-2017-shooting-star-ernst-young/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional Female Shooting Star award for Stockholm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was awarded in November 2017. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stina shares,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Few entrepreneurs succeed alone, and this award would not be possible without a fantastic team. As American anthropologist Margaret Mead once said, ‘Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it&#8217;s the only thing that ever has’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual Entrepreneur of the Year awards recognize exceptional business leaders who create products and services that drive a healthier worldwide economy. Specifically, the Female Shooting Star award is reserved for the woman who leads significant company growth in a short period of time. Ernst &amp; Young organizes and distributes the awards regionally, nationally, and internationally with a mission to encourage entrepreneurial interest and inspiration among future generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judging committee </span><a href="http://www.ey.com/se/sv/newsroom/news-releases/pressmeddelande-2018-01-25-claes-mellgren-och-per-olof-andersson-ar-sveriges-framsta-entreprenorer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concludes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Stina Ehrensvard has developed the solution for a growing problem and created an international company. The path from idea to success was not a straight line, but thanks to drive and dedicated work she found the key to success. Her product may be small, but it makes the difference for internet security across the globe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn more about Stina’s entrepreneurial journey and the passion, technology and teamwork that contributed to Yubico’s success, read more about her story in </span><a href="http://bit.ly/2kAvfme"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entreprenör Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/work/female-silicon-valley-ceo-517336"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marie Claire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies who take data privacy seriously all have five things in common. If you are advocating for better data privacy in your organization, you want to start with a security program that supports these efforts. Such a program has a few common characteristics. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Leadership buy-in</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Prioritizing the protection of data and systems starts at the top. The entire executive team, including the CEO and the Board, must know that security is a key priority for your organization. Otherwise, when it comes to allocating finances and resources, security will take a back seat.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This can seem daunting, but it’s actually becoming less difficult to receive this sort of leadership buy-in. For those who ever need a good selling point, just look at the volume and tone of press coverage after some of the most recent data breaches.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>A person responsible for security and privacy</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Explicitly identify and designate one individual who is responsible for overall security and privacy at the company. This means building out a C-level position to own all aspects of security and privacy, as well as legal and compliance risks. Not only will this ensure that there is a holistic, comprehensive approach to the security and privacy strategy, but it will also help further leadership buy-in by giving security a seat at the executive table and decision-making process. By having security and privacy at the company leadership level, the group can better work with the business by planning for organizational initiatives rather than being surprised by them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>A culture of security and privacy</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It’s no surprise that a lot of security and privacy incidents within an enterprise are related to human errors. With tight deadlines and busy schedules, it can be attractive for ambitious, well-intentioned employees to cut corners, and security is usually one of the first areas to take a hit. Reusing passwords, using easily-guessed passwords, sharing credentials, leaving work devices unattended or unlocked, and mistakenly clicking on malicious links are just a few common employee practices that result in breaches. Employees have a job to do, and if security hinders them rather than helps them, they will work around controls they don’t understand.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Companies that take security and privacy seriously run programs that are designed to ensure every employee knows, understands, and follows company security and privacy protocols. These programs also have clear expectations and consequences for failure to abide by the policies. To be clear, this doesn’t—and shouldn’t—mean leading with fear. It means taking the time to educate different groups of people about the negative impact a data breach could have on revenue, safety, and overall company health and reputation. The best security and privacy teams focus on enabling employees to do their best work by enabling them to do security right.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Clear processes and policies</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Having a good governance framework won&#8217;t matter if users aren&#8217;t familiar with the processes and policies involved. After all, it’s important to ensure that the plan can actually be implemented.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It’s also critical to know how to measure the success of the program. The ability to demonstrate the return on investment (ROI) for security products and services is invaluable to CEOs and the Board. Return on mitigation (ROM) is another valuable metric. This shifts the conversation from the potential losses of risk as business gains by calculating how much would not be lost through effective mitigation.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>An incident response plan</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">While no company wants to deal with a data breach, companies that prepare for doing so before it happens weather the storm better. After you get compromised is a terrible time to draft the notification to the board and your customers, and is just as bad for figuring out how to determine what happened and stop it.  A clear, and tested, response plan helps all parties involved know what to do, what their role is, and how to communicate internally and externally.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Yubico, we are experts at authentication—trusted by millions all around the globe to guide them through securing access to devices, networks, and web applications. That’s because we drive innovation and have modernized strong authentication, making strong two factor authentication (2FA) easy to use, all while reducing IT costs.</span></p>

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, Yubico is partnering with the </span><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Cybersecurity Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NCSA) to support and promote </span><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Privacy Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an initiative to empower individuals and encourage businesses to respect privacy, safeguard data, and enable trust. While Data Privacy Day is a one-day event taking place on January 28, security is our focus at Yubico everyday, and we are starting the conversation about online security and privacy early! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to compromised internet security, it can be difficult to know what you’re defending against, because attacker objectives, victims, and techniques vary significantly. That said, we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know that internet credential theft and misuse is involved in </span><a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 81%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of hacker-related breaches. Since stealing someone&#8217;s password or other authentication data is relatively easy to do from afar, and there&#8217;s little risk of or danger in getting caught, it&#8217;s become one of the most common attacks in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this two-part blog series, we will uncover some of the most common techniques for stealing internet credentials, popular and proven methods of defending against these attacks, and best practices to keep your data safe. Before we can effectively protect ourselves online, we must first understand the threats that we’re facing. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Weak Password Guessing </b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Attackers try <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/12/19/the-25-most-used-hackable-passwords-2017-star-wars-freedom/">common passwords</a> with specific or common usernames across many sites, and this can be surprisingly successful. Unfortunately, most people struggle with creating or remembering strong passwords. As a result, people often <a href="https://wpengine.com/unmasked/">choose weak passwords</a> for convenience, or because they don&#8217;t think it matters, and rarely change them if circumstances change.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Password Reuse Abuse &#8211; Credential Stuffing</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Attackers regularly take credentials stolen from one site and try them on another, as it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-have-i-been-pwned/">very common</a> for people to use the same password, or a variant, across multiple sites. This problem is exacerbated by the large volume of stolen credentials available for sale on the dark web with hundreds of millions of credentials available to attackers. Attackers have also reportedly targeted weaker sites to gain an individual’s credentials. If they’re successful, they’ll use those same credentials on other sites that they&#8217;re actually interested in.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Man in the Middle (MitM) Attacks</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Sometimes, attackers have access to the network path between their victim&#8217;s computer and the site they are accessing. This can enable the attacker to view what sites someone is accessing and steal their data if the connection is not encrypted or if the victim believes the attacker’s system is legitimate.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">This <a href="http://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/man-in-the-middle-attack-MitM">privileged position</a> can be used to wait for users to access the site of interest, or it can be used in combination with other techniques, such as phishing, to entice someone to visit the site of interest.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Phishing</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Phishing carries <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/357321/whats-worse-for-your-account-a-data-breach-or-a-phishing-a">serious risks</a> for internet users. Credential phishing typically uses some pretext to convince a person to reveal their credentials directly, or to visit some site that does the same. Attackers do this via SMS verification, email, telephone, instant message, social networks, dating sites, physical mail, or by any other means available.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Account Recovery Exploitation</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Due to the large scale of users for many services and the general desire to keep support costs low everywhere, account recovery flows can be much weaker than the primary authentication channel. For example, it&#8217;s common for companies deploying strong two-factor authentication (2FA) solutions as their primary method to leave SMS as a backup. Alternatively, companies may simply allow help desk personnel to reset credentials or set temporary bypass codes with just a phone call and little to no identity verification requirements.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Services implementing 2FA need to strengthen both the primary and the recovery login flow so that users aren’t compromised by the weaker path.</p>
<p><b><em>The Silver Lining</em></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an equally <em>surprisingly</em> easy and affordable way to protect online accounts from all of these attacks. It’s called FIDO </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal 2nd Factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (U2F), a modern security protocol invented by Yubico and Google that is specifically designed to help online services and users tackle these common attacker techniques. Since its inception in 2012, U2F has become widely adopted by many services, including Gmail, Dropbox, Facebook, GitHub, Salesforce.com, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The protocol works by registering a physical hardware device, like the YubiKey, with your service. Once paired, the service will challenge you to provide your account password (something you know) and to present your YubiKey (something you have) by inserting it into the USB port and touching the gold contact (called test of user presence). There are no codes to type or apps to load. The YubiKey does the work for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single U2F device, like the YubiKey, can be used with nearly unlimited services and accounts all while providing data privacy. That’s because the YubiKey generates a new pair of keys for every service, and only that service stores that specific public key. With this approach, no secrets are shared between service providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does the YubiKey stop hackers even when they’ve stolen your account password? Without also stealing your YubiKey (a physical device), an attacker can’t get access to your account. Once you’ve turned on U2F, you can also help secure your accounts against account recovery exploitations by turning off less secure forms of 2FA like SMS, wherever possible. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important facets of enterprise security is ensuring protection for all employee accounts. Password sharing methods play a critical role. When pressed for time, many users resort to sending unencrypted plain-text passwords via high risk channels like chat or email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other ways to securely share passwords across teams throughout an organization—and writing it on a post-it note and leaving it on your co-worker’s desk is not one of them. Two recommended practices include: </span></p>
<p><b>Creating an audit trail. </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an audit trail, organizations are able to track the users who request passwords and the purpose for which they intend to use them, offering a way for organizations to discover potential password misuse. Additionally, being able to provide evidence of who has seen what in an organization is a compliance measure in known laws and frameworks.</span></p>
<p><b>Enforcing a strict need-to-know policy.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving users access to assets that are neither relevant nor useful to them on a daily basis only raises the risks for unauthorized access in the future. Limiting access to accounts and assets can help mitigate the probability of exposed sensitive data.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_6390" style="width: 296px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://storedsafe.com"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6390" class="wp-image-6390 size-full" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/partners_storedsafe.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="114" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-6390" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: StoredSafe</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an in-depth understanding of enterprise password challenges, Yubico ecosystem partner StoredSafe launched their own password manager, Password StoredSafe. It safely stores and shares enterprise passwords, as well as the critical information related to passwords, on a need-to-know basis and with a full audit trail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of StoredSafe’s solutions enforce two-factor authentication (2FA)—a testament to their commitment to password security. StoredSafe </span><a href="https://storedsafe.com/platform/#auth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly recommends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the YubiKey and the YubiHSM for the strong hardware-backed 2FA protection they offer. With YubiKey 2FA enabled, unauthorized users cannot gain access to passwords and the enterprise secrets they protect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The YubiKey is the only hardware token StoredSafe supports since we integrated 2FA back in 2010. To further improve security, we have also incorporated the YubiHSM into our platform as a safe storage for all cryptographic keys. Both are easy to implement and empower our users to work independently from the internet and other networking services,” said Fredrik Soderblom, StoredSafe CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">StoredSafe continues to expand their product portfolio to help organizations meet and implement internal security policies around critical and sensitive information. Beyond their password manager, StoredSafe also offers 2FA StoredSafe for implementing two-factor authentication to existing IT infrastructures, Certificate StoredSafe for monitoring and holding certificate information, and File StoredSafe for securely storing confidential data. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protecting your organization from a potential data breach starts with providing secure two-factor authentication (2FA) for all employees. Once employees are protected, you need to think about  vendors and third parties that have access to your network, customer files, and other sensitive data. Do they have the appropriate protections put in place?</p>
<p>According to a recent<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/11/new-research-understanding-root-cause.html"> Google study</a>, 3.3 billion user credentials were exposed by third-party breaches from March 2016 to March 2017. For example, <a href="https://versasec.com/blog/more-target">Target was the victim</a> of a big data breach in 2013 that started when their HVAC vendor’s credentials were compromised. Breaches through third-parties can be greatly reduced or completely avoided by mandating use of 2FA in order to access your systems.</p>
<p>The use of 2FA is one of the most powerful and well established techniques for strengthening credentials. It’s been around since the 1970s with the introduction of smart card technology &#8212;  although, deploying and managing 2FA with smart cards has historically been cumbersome. Since then, smart card 2FA has advanced with new, easy-to-use technologies such as the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/applications/identity-and-access-management/versasec/">YubiKey</a> and <a href="https://versasec.com">Versasec</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_231169" style="width: 495px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-231169" class="wp-image-231169" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/versasec_logo-1-444x97.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="106" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/versasec_logo-1-444x97.jpg 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/versasec_logo-1-768x167.jpg 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/versasec_logo-1-1030x224.jpg 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/versasec_logo-1-705x153.jpg 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/versasec_logo-1-450x98.jpg 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/versasec_logo-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px" /><p id="caption-attachment-231169" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: Versasec</p></div>
<p>Together, these technologies allow organizations to quickly increase security. Not only can enterprises mandate 2FA for employees and third parties, but they can also manage each user’s level of access and revoke it as needed by utilizing <a href="https://www.yubico.com/applications/identity-and-access-management/versasec/">Versasec’s secure identity &amp; access management</a> solution. Versasec eases the deployment of 2FA with smart cards for organizations of any size by enabling admins to issue and manage user credentials. Users are then able to easily and securely authenticate to enterprise systems from across the cloud to SasS and on-premise applications..</p>
<p>With Versasec’s vSEC:CMS, enterprises can provision a YubiKey for each user, letting them quickly authenticate for login, secure email, or code signing and more with a simple touch using their YubiKey as a PIV-compatible smart card and reader. vSEC:CMS also allows the user to securely unblock their pin or load new certificates on their YubiKeys. Administrators can manage, revoke or renew all registered YubiKeys using the vSEC:CMS. The ability to centrally manage user identity and access to critical data across all the different services with Versasec, is a huge win for organizations and admins.</p>
<p>Whether an organization has 20 or 200,000 employees, the YubiKey offers fast and simple deployment. We provide a hosted validation service, open source software and servers. Partners can easily work within the <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/">multiple security protocols supported by YubiKeys</a>: OpenPGP, PIV, FIDO U2F, and more.</p>

<section class="av_textblock_section"  itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting" itemprop="blogPost" ><div class='avia_textblock '   itemprop="text" ><p><a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-3.pdf">According to the NIST SP 800-63-3,</a> digital identity is “the online persona of a subject”. Unlike personal identity, an individual can convey multiple digital identities across various networks and communities, so one person can have a digital identity for their work email and another for a social media account.</p>
<p>Given the possibility of multiple digital identities, correctly proving an individual is who they say they are on an online service or network is not as easy as glancing at a face and a name tag. Ensuring that only the authentic user is given access may require identity proofing. The identity proofing process relies upon various factors, such as the presentation of identity documents issued by another provider, biographic information, biometric information, and knowledge of personally relevant information or events.</p>
<p>As the process for identity proofing is done both online and remotely, it is used in conjunction with identity federation and strong authentication to protect an individual’s digital identity. Identity federation is the process of securely exchanging identity and security information between an identity provider (IdP) and an online service or network. Identity federation relies on strong authentication like FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (FIDO U2F) to protect against phishing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and session hijacking.</p>
<div id="attachment_230815" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.digidentity.eu/en/home/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230815" class="wp-image-230815 size-medium" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DIGI_logo_li_rgb2-444x106.png" alt="" width="444" height="106" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DIGI_logo_li_rgb2-444x106.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DIGI_logo_li_rgb2-768x183.png 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DIGI_logo_li_rgb2-1030x246.png 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DIGI_logo_li_rgb2.png 1500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DIGI_logo_li_rgb2-705x168.png 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DIGI_logo_li_rgb2-450x107.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-230815" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: Digidentity</p></div>
<p>Using a centralized digital identity through a FIDO U2F-enabled IdP like Digidentity is an economical and effective alternative to securing multiple digital identities independently. An effective example of this is GOV.UK Verify, a secure online verification service Yubico piloted with Digidentity and the UK’s Government Digital Service (GDS) in 2016. This is the first government service in the world to support FIDO U2F. The GOV.UK Verify project was later lauded and awarded <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2016/05/u2f-best-innovation-egovernment-awarded-eic-2016/">“Best Innovation in eGovernment/eCitizen”</a> at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2016 Awards.</p>
<p>The success of GOV.UK Verify marked an important milestone both for individual users and governments looking to leverage identity data as a way of securing online government services while safeguarding privacy. Today, using Digidentity federated authentication services and FIDO U2F with the YubiKey, UK citizens can conveniently access a number of government services online with the utmost security and privacy. Beyond government services, Digidentity also provides IdP services to insurers, financial institutions, and organizations.</p>
<p>By creating a robust identity ecosystem combining identity proofing, identity federation, and strong authentication with FIDO U2F, Yubico and Digidentity keep our commitment to protecting and preserving the digital identities of millions of individuals across the globe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Organizations that outsource certain business functions to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers enjoy many benefits, including cost efficiency and increased productivity. However, despite the advantages, there also comes the potential risks of privacy and data compromise.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of cloud computing, SaaS providers are required to take necessary steps and precautions to prove the security, reliability, and integrity of their data processing operations in order to do business with government agencies, financial institutions, healthcare organizations, and others. These compliance directives are designed to protect customers and provide assurance to them that their privacy is kept intact. Before making the switch, organizations evaluating SaaS services need to ensure that their SaaS provider of choice meets these compliance requirements.</p>

<div id="attachment_230069" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-230069" class="wp-image-230069 size-medium" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sentry-logo-black-444x155.png" alt="" max width="300" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sentry-logo-black-444x155.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sentry-logo-black-710x250.png 710w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sentry-logo-black-705x245.png 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sentry-logo-black-450x157.png 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sentry-logo-black.png 718w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-230069" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: Sentry</p></div>

<p>As both a SaaS provider and open source error tracking platform, Sentry—a Yubico ecosystem partner—understands the gravity of security and compliance. Sentry adheres to certification and compliance standards including HIPAA / HITECH, PCI DSS, and Privacy Shield, among others. Sentry is committed to securing both users and applications by eliminating systems vulnerability and using industry-standard technologies to protect data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and loss.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.sentry.io/2016/06/22/introducing-2fa">Sentry encourages two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> as an important step towards securing data access from unauthorized users, and integrates the strongest level of 2FA with the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/">YubiKey</a> and FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F). The YubiKey meets NIST 800-63-3 Authenticator Assurance Level 2/3, and certification for FIPS 140-2 Overall Level 2 is in progress.</p>

<p>“I feel a lot safer accessing and managing our company’s cloud databases with Sentry and the YubiKey,” said Mike, a Sentry enterprise customer admin. “Without 2FA, we risk access to our company’s cloud service and internal systems, which—if a malicious user gets through—can take down our production fleet. Enforcing YubiKey 2FA with Sentry is the right thing to do. It’s easy, and it works.”</p>

<p>With trust at the core of their business, Sentry takes security very seriously. That is evident in their compliance and certification efforts. By offering strong 2FA with the YubiKey, Sentry demonstrates an unrelenting commitment not only to their users’ privacy, but also to their duty as a SaaS provider to ensure the integrity of their platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the increasing frequency and scale of identity threats including phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks (MiTM), the best way to prevent a breach is to provide strong multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is designed to protect against the range of attacks that rely on stealing user credentials. Organizations can use a variety of techniques, but all work by requiring the user to provide something in addition to their primary password— something the user is, has, or knows—before they can be authenticated.</p>
<p>Deploying strong MFA that is easy-to-use for employees and easy-to-manage for admins can be quickly accomplished with <a href="https://www.yubico.com/applications/identity-and-access-management/okta/">Okta’s Adaptive MFA</a> and the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/compare-yubikeys/">unphishable YubiKey</a>. Adding the YubiKey as a hard token to the Okta Adaptive MFA solution strengthens the MFA by requiring the user to have a physical token verifying their identity. This is also a great option for global organizations that need to provide strong authentication to comply with regulations such as the European Union’s <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/10/key-gdpr-compliance-online-privacy-protection/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR).</p>
<div id="attachment_229519" style="width: 368px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-229519" class="wp-image-229519" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Okta_Logo_BrightBlue_Large-1-444x150.png" alt="" width="300" height="121" /><p id="caption-attachment-229519" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: Okta</p></div>
<p>Adaptive authentication means the level of authentication required is flexible depending on how much risk a user presents. Every time a user logs in using Okta Adaptive MFA, the system analyzes the request to determine how much access to grant.</p>
<p>With strong MFA in place, even if a user’s password is stolen, user accounts are safe from unauthorized access. Enabling Okta’s MFA and pairing with the YubiKey, will protect business-critical data from the most prevalent attacks on the Internet today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-left: 0px;"><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/">Firefox Quantum</a> is the latest internet browser to natively support FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) devices, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to see this advancement! With Mozilla jumping on board, millions of Firefox users can now begin to experience the ease-of-use and security of the YubiKey and U2F authentication...with one small caveat. FIDO U2F is not turned on by default in the Firefox browser.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0px;">If you’re among the individuals testing the FIDO U2F YubiKey with Firefox Quantum, you’ve likely already experienced a few common challenges. First, FIDO U2F is not a default setting with the latest Firefox browser. It requires configuration in advanced settings. Second, even after enabling FIDO U2F, some services may not recognize it. We understand that this can be frustrating or inconvenient for users, and as a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/">principal inventor of the FIDO U2F open authentication standard</a>, we’d like to provide additional clarity and guidance.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Why isn’t FIDO U2F a default setting in Firefox Quantum?</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Mozilla plans to only support the out-of-the-box experience with FIDO U2F devices using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">Web Authentication APIs</a> (as part of FIDO 2) versus FIDO U2F APIs. Per the company’s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/CryptoEngineering#Using_U2F_.2F_WebAuthn">Security/Crypto Engineering wiki page</a>, they intend to “...permit use of U2F tokens via a user-controllable preference (not on by default) in Firefox 56 or 57 (Done in Firefox 57), and Web Authentication (on by default) in Firefox 59 or 60.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In many ways, FIDO 2 is the next-generation of FIDO U2F, as it will pave the way for things like multi-factor and <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/06/future-of-fido-demo-by-microsoft-cis/">passwordless login</a>, while still supporting two-factor authentication (2FA) functionalities of the original FIDO U2F standard. As Web Authentication specifications will likely not be complete until early 2018, users will need to wait for the seamless experience with U2F devices in Firefox until the Web Authentication API integration is done.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>How do I enable FIDO U2F in Firefox Quantum?</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">While the FIDO U2F experience in Firefox is limited at the moment, turning it on is very simple. It only takes three steps.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">1. Type <b>about:config</b> into the Firefox browser.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">2. Search for “u2f”.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Even after enabling FIDO U2F in Firefox Quantum, why won’t YubiKeys work for some U2F-enabled sites?</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Integrating with <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.2-ps-20170411/fido-u2f-javascript-api-v1.2-ps-20170411.html">FIDO U2F v1.1 JS API</a> will allow a developer’s web app to support U2F on Firefox. That said, it’s important to understand that every FIDO U2F implementation can vary from the official specifications. For example, Mozilla did not fully implement the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.2-ps-20170411/fido-appid-and-facets-v1.2-ps-20170411.html">FIDO AppID and Facet Specification</a>. Some sites supporting FIDO U2F have made accommodations for the incompleteness of Firefox’s implementation, but some have not. In other situations, some services may not work with Firefox Quantum because of a service-specific implementation. For this reason, Firefox Quantum users are currently having trouble authenticating with their FIDO U2F devices for some sites that typically support FIDO U2F devices. Our recommendation? Make a request to both Mozilla and that particular service to refine their FIDO U2F support, allowing for Firefox compatibility.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0px;">Ultimately, Mozilla’s FIDO U2F support is a huge progression toward strong, unphishable authentication. We can only hope to see the platform’s FIDO U2F authentication experience grow to become seamless and simple as the FIDO standard intends.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to security, organizations have a lot of moving parts to consider. From mobile and desktop devices to servers, line-of-business applications, cloud storage, social media accounts, and more—these are all resources that can contain sensitive company information. Naturally, it's important to minimize the security risk associated with these channels to help protect enterprise assets.</p>

<p>For many years, privileged user credentials have offered a solution: only specific individuals have the greatest levels of access to the most sensitive company infrastructure and data. While this is a crucial component in the context of the overall security architecture, the trust, authority, and access granted to privileged users also marks these accounts as 'highly desirable' for malicious hackers.</p>

<div id="attachment_228121" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://liebsoft.com/?utm_source=yubico&amp;amp;utm_medium=ecosystem%20showcase%20blog"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-228121" class="wp-image-228121 size-medium" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/RGB_LiebermanSoftware_FlatLogo_Vertical_1024x410-ppt-444x178.png" alt="" width="300" height="178" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-228121" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: Lieberman Software</p></div>

<p><a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+Privileged+Identity+Management+Q3+2016/-/E-RES123903">The Forrester Wave: Privileged Identity Management, Q3 2016 Report</a> estimates that 80% of security breaches involve privileged credentials, and states that privileged credentials provide greater scope for stealing data en masse compared to individual accounts. The report also recognizes that privileged identity management demands an integrated approach that includes multi-factor authentication (MFA) and security assertion markup language (SAML) compatibility.</p>

<p>To ensure that sensitive data is not compromised via privileged credentials, it is absolutely necessary for organizations to deploy proper security precautions, and to be mindful of which users and assets to grant privileges to. Implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) or MFA for administrative access to web applications and other devices that store vital information is an effective way to mitigate these threats. Extending the use of strong authentication to your entire end-user base can also reduce the threat and effectiveness of stolen credentials.</p>

<p>Yubico and Lieberman Software are working together to protect organizations from credential threats like keylogging, social engineering, and other cyber attacks. With its support for the YubiKey, Lieberman Software enables its customers to implement flexible and cost-effective MFA using the YubiKey One Time Password (OTP) and smart card authentication protocols. For large and complex environments, the integration between Lieberman RED - Rapid Enterprise Defense Identity Management and the YubiKey significantly strengthens security for automated privileged identity and access management.</p>

<p>RED Identity Management secures administrative credentials throughout your IT infrastructure including: super-user login accounts on systems and device, service accounts, SSH keys, application credentials, database admin accounts, and cloud identities. Unlike competing, closed solutions, the YubiKey is flexible enough to be re-seeded by authorized IT administrators through the RED Identity Management interface, eliminating the need to rely on third-party vendors to replace compromised tokens.</p>

<p>Protecting privileged credentials is an essential step in protecting your organization’s data. For more information on using Lieberman RED Identity Management with the YubiKey, please visit <a href="https://liebsoft.com/partners/technology-integrations/yubico/">https://liebsoft.com/partners/technology-integrations/yubico/</a> or contact <a href="mailto:sales@liebsoft.com">sales@liebsoft.com</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Centrify is a longtime Yubico partner, and together we bring two-factor authentication (2FA) and security to organizations and their global workforces. Today, we are excited to further enhance our <a href="https://www.centrify.com/about-us/news/press-releases/2017/centrify-innovations-embrace-zero-trust-security/">joint partnership with Centrify’s </a>commitment to support <a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/">FIDO Universal 2nd Factor</a> (FIDO U2F) within the Centrify platform. The platform’s upgraded security will be available on December 16, 2017, expanding upon the PIV-compatible smart card and one-time passcode (OTP) features of the YubiKey that have been available to Centrify customers since February of 2016.</p>
<p>FIDO U2F is a two-factor authentication (2FA) security protocol created by Yubico and Google that defends against phishing and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Centrify’s support for FIDO U2F will give their customers the ability meet the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) highest Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL3) as an alternative option to smart cards, outlined in the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/06/nist-publishes-sp800-63-3-fido-u2f-achieves-aal3/">NIST Special Publication 800-63 Revision3</a>. To achieve AAL3, this new option now allows a single factor cryptographic device like the YubiKey with FIDO U2F protocol enabled, combined with the user’s password, to authenticate with Centrify’s platform.</p>
<div id="attachment_228169" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-228169" class="wp-image-228169" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Centrify-logo-RGB.jpg" alt=""/><p id="caption-attachment-228169" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: Centrify</p></div>
<p>“As principal inventor behind the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) open authentication standard, Yubico believes that secure, easy-to-use and scalable authentication should be available to everyone ” said Jerrod Chong, VP of Product at Yubico. “Centrify shares our mission to bring greater security and convenience to the enterprise. By adding FIDO U2F support, Centrify has the most complete set of YubiKey integrations available from a technology partner.”</p>
<p>“The old days of the guarded castle with a moat, where all interactions inside the castle were trusted and all interactions outside the castle were suspect, no longer applies,” said Bill Mann, Chief Product Officer at Centrify. “Remote employees on BYOD devices accessing SaaS applications are as much a reality today as someone sitting at their workstation inside the office. At Centrify, we are committed to helping our customers embrace this new reality and  where all access must be authenticated, authorized and encrypted.”</p>
<p>When available from Centrify, enabling FIDO U2F or your organization is simple. Users will love how easy it is to log in with the YubiKey.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4bY_vjBLBVAeGxtWlRBSjVheHc/view" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2017 Thales Data Threat Report</a>, nearly two thirds (63%) of senior security executives polled indicated that their organizations deploy new technologies such as cloud, big data, IOT, and containers before having the security in place to protect them. With 88% feeling vulnerable to a cyberattack, organizations are now starting to shift their focus to securing all these new technologies with multi-factor authentication (MFA). In fact, the report shows that US and global retail organizations rank MFA in the top 3 data security tools they plan to implement this year.</p>

<div id="attachment_224034" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-224034" class="size-medium wp-image-224034" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnionID_Logo_M1A1_Trans-Kopie.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnionID_Logo_M1A1_Trans-Kopie.png 9999w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnionID_Logo_M1A1_Trans-Kopie-444x175.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnionID_Logo_M1A1_Trans-Kopie-768x302.png 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnionID_Logo_M1A1_Trans-Kopie-1030x405.png 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnionID_Logo_M1A1_Trans-Kopie-1500x590.png 1500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnionID_Logo_M1A1_Trans-Kopie-705x277.png 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/OnionID_Logo_M1A1_Trans-Kopie-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 9999px) 100vw, 9999px" /><p id="caption-attachment-224034" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: Onion ID</p></div>

<p>Yubico ecosystem partner Onion ID offers organizations the opportunity to use various methods of authentication—ranging from biometrics to location to security keys—to protect any web application or server in their IT infrastructure. Onion ID secures privileges for accounts on any server, container, and SaaS applications, and acts as a single pane of glass to provide security, visibility, and auditing to organizations of all sizes.</p>

<p>“Before we integrated YubiKey support, our customers used MFA methods that required their employees to use their mobile phones to verify their identity. To complete the mobile authentication process, data has to be trafficked to and from the internet, which is not ideal or secure for customers handling sensitive data, such as medical and financial information. If an organization doesn’t want to pass their employees’ information through the internet or have their employees install an app on their phones, what we recommend is a hardware-based security key like the YubiKey,” said Onion ID founder Anirban Banerjee.</p>

<p>While still common in enterprise security, mobile authentication methods like SMS and phone calls are essentially unencrypted and vulnerable to phishing. Phone and SMS networks have been exploited by governments, criminal gangs, and even penetration testing firms. Phone companies can also provide access to personal records if required to by legal order or if they are hacked or tricked. </p>

<p>“Organizations need an MFA solution they can fully control without needing to download and use third-party apps like Google Authenticator. Our customers find that the YubiKey offers them just that — an MFA option that is easy, affordable, and can help control exactly what an employee can do on a server or a SaaS application,” said Anirban.</p>

<p>With support for <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yubico OTP</a>, Onion ID successfully combines versatility with ease of use and security to protect privileged accounts on AWS, Rackspace, and more. Yubico OTP works with no client software needed, allows for self-provisioning, as well as authenticating without a username, and is easy to implement.</p>

<p>“Integrating Yubico OTP was simple and did not take a lot of effort from our side. The API documentation is clear, and there was excellent communication between our teams. It took us about 2 weeks for the initial integration, and 1 week for fine tuning. We also use the YubiKey internally and are happy with our experience,” he added.</p>

<p>Onion ID offers a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) security solution that enables organizations to control access across all their properties in 60 seconds.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting your organization does not need to be complicated, frustrating or costly. The simple addition of strong authentication paired with seamless identity access management can significantly reduce security risks across an entire organization by making it simple to deploy and easy for employees to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The focus on a strong, simple authentication experience is something Duo Security and Yubico have offered together since 2013, when a security need from </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/reference-customers/facebook/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sparked the partnership. Facebook needed to provide secure, simple, and seamless authentication </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to all their employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also needed support for frequent logins and quick deployment to 30,000+ employees with minimal overhead and support costs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After careful consideration, the company looked to the advanced authentication solutions provided by both Duo Security and Yubico. Together, our joint solution addressed Facebook’s authentication priorities—placing equal emphasis on usability and security.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Organizations are looking for flexible options that can meet the needs of a diverse and mobile workforce, and more often than not, they are looking to several solutions to do so,” said Jerrod Chong, VP of Product at Yubico. “That is why Yubico’s integration with Duo Security is one that we, and our customers, value. Together, through the use of the YubiKey and cloud-based authentication on the backend, we’re able to provide a seamless, flexible, and highly-secure authentication experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Yubico and Duo Security support the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO Universal 2nd Factor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (U2F), a two-factor authentication (2FA) security protocol developed by Yubico and Google that effectively defends against phishing and man-in-the middle (MitM) attacks. In June 2017, the </span><a href="https://www.nist.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Institute of Standards and Technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NIST) recognized FIDO U2F at the highest Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL3) in their </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/06/nist-publishes-sp800-63-3-fido-u2f-achieves-aal3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIST Special Publication 800-63 Revision3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Duo, we place a heavy focus on end user experience. From frictionless user experiences to quick and seamless deployments, we aim to make authentication with Duo Security exceptionally easy,” said Ash Devata, VP of Product at Duo Security. “At the same time, we take security seriously and constantly improve authentication effectiveness. This is exactly why we added support for the YubiKey and FIDO U2F. As a globally recognized leading authentication standard, U2F is something we absolutely want our customers having access to.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_223177" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223177" class="size-medium wp-image-223177" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DUO-Logo.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DUO-Logo.png 500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DUO-Logo-444x266.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DUO-Logo-450x270.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-223177" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: Duo Security</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to FIDO U2F, the YubiKey and Duo Security support other authentication protocols including Yubico OTP (one time password), PIV (smart card), OpenPGP, and more. This functionality is loved by joint customers for the flexibility to choose 2FA methods that fit the needs of a diverse user base.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey provides an easy-to-use and secure way to protect applications that support FIDO U2F standards, as well as additional applications such as VPNs, SSH, RDP, and more, using the same physical form factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about utilizing the YubiKey and FIDO U2F with Duo Security, instructions are provided during the initial Duo </span><a href="https://guide.duo.com/enrollment"><span style="font-weight: 400;">self-enrollment process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are already enrolled in Duo Security using a different device for two factor authentication, such as your mobile phone, you can add a YubiKey (security token) as an additional authentication device from the </span><a href="https://guide.duo.com/manage-devices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">device management portal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <a href="http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verizon 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, gaining access to a user’s personal or professional data through a malicious email is a cyber criminal’s weapon of choice. While many users might consider that there is nothing worth taking inside their inbox, they are most likely overlooking how connected their email is to other digital accounts. Stolen email credentials can unlock other accounts, and reusing passwords across multiple logins makes that risk even greater.</span></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing attacks are amongst the most prevalent of threats to email, and typically use some pretext to convince you to reveal your credentials directly or to visit a fake login page that prompts you to do the same. Phishing alone is responsible for huge monetary losses each year, and sadly still affects around 1 in 14 users. There are a number of precautions you could take to avoid being phished, starting with using an email platform that enables two-factor authentication and an unphishable YubiKey.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our trusted tech partner FastMail has made security a core feature of their email platform. FastMail provides an extensive range of encryption practices to keep your data safe from prying eyes, including full support for two-factor authentication. With FIDO U2F and YubiKey One Time Password (OTP) integrated into their services, FastMail <a href="https://blog.fastmail.com/2016/07/23/how-u2f-security-keys-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommends setting up YubiKey 2FA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the peace of mind that comes with additional security. </span></p>

<div id="attachment_221470" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption alignright right"><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-221470" class="wp-image-221470 size-medium" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FastMail-Logo-RGB@2x-444x142.png" alt="" width="444" height="142" srcset="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FastMail-Logo-RGB@2x-444x142.png 444w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FastMail-Logo-RGB@2x-768x246.png 768w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FastMail-Logo-RGB@2x-1030x329.png 1030w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FastMail-Logo-RGB@2x-1500x480.png 1500w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FastMail-Logo-RGB@2x-705x225.png 705w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FastMail-Logo-RGB@2x-450x144.png 450w, https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FastMail-Logo-RGB@2x.png 1776w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-221470" class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: FastMail</p></div>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“FastMail has built its reputation by offering highly secure login mechanisms. The YubiKey provides a simple yet robust solution, ensuring that people can log in and access their email on any machine without the worry of their authentication details being stolen,” says FastMail co-founder Rob Mueller.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">FastMail has been hosting email for companies and discerning individuals around the world since 1999, making it one of the longest operating email services on the web. Trusted by over 150,000 users in 150 countries today, FastMail is an employee-owned, independent company headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, and runs a portfolio of communication and collaboration services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Topicbox, FastMail’s latest group email offering, is also now YubiKey-enabled. Topicbox increases productivity by providing unlimited groups to keep conversations organized, customized email delivery options to minimize distractions, and searchable team history for better onboarding. </p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Protecting your information is critical for every organization, so YubiKey support was natural to build into Topicbox from the start,” says FastMail's COO Helen Horstmann-Allen. “Topicbox makes communicating with your teams faster and easier, and Yubico does the same for your team’s security.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gluu was founded in 2009 to address challenges posed by an increasingly complex and proprietary web single sign-on (SSO) market.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Gluu Server was envisioned as a utility, open source platform that would enable more organizations to deliver a secure authentication service.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Gluu Server is used by universities, government agencies, and large enterprises around the world to securely identify people and manage access to resources.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Why Gluu?</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/hubfs/rp_DBIR_2017_Report_execsummary_en_xg.pdf">2017 Data Breach Investigations Report by Verizon</a>, more than 80% of hacking-related breaches leveraged stolen and/or weak passwords.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to protect your organization is to use a central authentication platform like the Gluu Server--the fewer places you store passwords and authenticate users, the easier it is to enforce strong security.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Gluu Server will empower your organization to improve security, reduce user friction, and more quickly roll out value added products and services to your communities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Gluu &amp; YubiKey</b></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Once web and mobile applications are leveraging your Gluu Server for user login, you can significantly improve security by enforcing strong authentication.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With the Gluu Server and the YubiKey, your people will be protected from phishing, malware, and man-in-the-middle attacks while maintaining secure and seamless single sign-on (SSO) access to resources across your digital kingdom.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Get started today by following these 3 easy steps:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">1. <a href="https://gluu.org/docs/ce/3.1.1/installation-guide/?utm_source=yubico%20blog&amp;utm_medium=gluu%20ecosystem%20highlight">Deploy</a> the free open source Gluu Server</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are only 8 weeks left before the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) deadline, and now is the right time for US government contractors to secure Active Directory users. DFARS was structured to protect unclassified US Department of Defense (DoD) information on a contractor’s internal information system from cyber incidents, and to minimize the loss of information via cyber incident reporting and damage assessment processes.</p>

<p>Government contractors are required to implement the mandatory controls for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) detailed in <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf">NIST SP 800-171</a>, a key component of which is to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accounts that access privileged data.</p>

<div style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.authlite.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-218733" src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AuthLite.png" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ecosystem Showcase: AuthLite </p></div>

<p>“<em>Whether you're implementing DFARS/NIST, PCI, HIPAA compliance, or just moving to strong authentication, securing your user accounts with static passwords isn't enough anymore. The AuthLite two-factor system for Active Directory is inspired by the simple model of YubiKeys, and designed to solve this issue,</em>” said Greg Bell, CEO and Founder of AuthLite.</p>

<p>Together, Yubico and AuthLite offer a joint solution for government contractors and organizations seeking DFARS compliance. AuthLite systems natively support YubiKeys so organizations can meet the multi-factor authentication requirements for local and network access outlined in the DFARS clause.</p>

<p>AuthLite enables your organization to natively process MFA in your Domain Controllers and connected systems, giving you the flexibility to implement YubiKey MFA to servers, computers, and users of your choice. AuthLite also gives your organization the opportunity to add YubiKeys for users at any time, and can quickly provision new YubiKeys as your organization grows.</p>

<p>The multi-protocol YubiKey is built to address privacy, validation, and compliance requirements across various standards and directives, including FIPS and NIST. The YubiKey combines three of the permitted authenticator types from the latest NIST digital identity guidelines in one physical device: OTP, FIDO U2F, and smart card / PIV-compatible / OpenPGP. In the same guidelines, NIST recognizes FIDO U2F at the highest authenticator assurance level, AAL3.</p>

<p>The YubiKey is loved by millions across the globe for its simplicity, security, and affordability. Your users will love the ease of use of the combined YubiKey and AuthLite solution.</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p><strong>Logging In</strong></p>
<ol>
 	<li>Simply press the YubiKey contact to enter a One-Time-Passcode (OTP)</li>
 	<li>Type the Active Directory password as usual</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Behind the Scenes</strong></p>

<p>On the Domain Controller, AuthLite validates the OTP, and changes the user's Kerberos ticket to contain an extra "two-factor tag" group. That way, your domain services can check whether a user logged in with one or two-factors, and decide whether to grant or deny access to sensitive resources.</p>

<p>“<em>AuthLite's unique power and flexibility comes from working with your Domain Controllers to improve the authentication in the core of your domain instead of just around the perimeter.  Even in simple networks, each customer's configuration might be different. We even provide Interactive Documentation, walkthrough videos, and include remote engineering assistance to make sure your multi-factor deployment is secure,</em>” said Bell.</p>

<p>Fun fact! AuthLite became Yubico’s first enterprise partner in 2009. With this joint solution, AuthLite and Yubico are ready and excited to help organizations and government contractors achieve DFARS compliance by the December 31 deadline.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were to ask someone who Yubico is or what we do, you’ll likely get the answer, ‘YubiKeys’, and rightfully so. YubiKeys are our foundation, and at the core of our mission to provide tried and true multi-factor authentication since 2008. They are used and loved by some of the world’s largest companies and by millions of individuals in more than 160 countries. But what a lot of people don’t know is that our product portfolio is more extensive. We’re also in the business of protecting servers and the keys stored on those servers, and today, we are thrilled to launch the YubiHSM 2. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True to Yubico form, the YubiHSM 2 defies a conventional design approach to hardware security modules (HSM) with the company’s signature traits of simplicity and affordability. The ultra-slim nano form factor YubiHSM 2 device is affordable at $650, offering advanced capabilities and benefits at a price within reach for all organizations. This is far from the traditional $10,000 HSM box that might typically come to mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many customers will use the YubiHSM 2 to secure their certificate authorities’ (CAs) root keys and to verify signatures. The YubiHSM 2 also offers advanced signing with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EdDSA curve 25519</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does the new YubiHSM 2 fit into your organization? Our VP of Product Jerrod Chong gives us a real-world snapshot of the YubiHSM 2 in action: </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q:</b><strong> Why would an enterprise or SMB have a need for an HSM?</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every organization needs to protect their server environments and the cryptographic keys stored on those servers. Approximately 95% of all IT breaches happen when a user credential or server gets hacked. HSM hardware delivers advanced protection to prevent the theft of keys while at rest or in use. This protects against both logical attacks against the server, such as zero-day exploits or malware, and physical theft of a server or its hard drive. However, most companies have taken a software-based approach, as hardware-based protection has always been cost prohibitive with traditional HSM solutions. That is not the case with the YubiHSM 2. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q: What would a typical YubiHSM 2 enterprise deployment look like? </b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A typical YubiHSM 2 deployment for enterprise would include the use of hardware-backed keys for a Microsoft-based PKI implementation. Deploying the YubiHSM 2 for Microsoft Active Directory Certificate services not only protects the CA root keys, but also protects all signing and verification services using the root key. For this particular type of YubiHSM 2 deployment,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">implementation is fairly plug-and-play.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q: What were some of the more unique or creative ways people were using YubiHSM 2 during the beta program? </b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">While protection of root keys for Microsoft AD Certificate services is a common use case, participants in our beta program also explored the use of the YubiHSM 2 for improving security on manufacturing lines, increasing security for IoT gateways and network appliances, and augmenting security on legacy SCADA.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q: Can the YubiHSM 2 be used on virtual systems?</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the YubiHSM 2 is network-sharable. While it plugs into a USB port on a host machine, communication is handled via a connector that can speak HTTPS. This means it can speak with any application connected to the network using HTTPS, a feature not previously available on the original YubiHSM model and not frequently supported by lower-priced HSMs. This can be especially advantageous on a physical server that is hosting multiple virtual machines (particularly for cloud applications), so organizations are not bound to the host machine USB ports.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q: The size of the YubiHSM 2 is rare for an HSM. What was the impetus behind selecting the “nano” form factor? </b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the drawbacks with traditional HSM solutions is that they are large in size, making it difficult to deploy on servers that use rack-based installations. The Yubico nano form factor allows the HSM to be inserted </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">completely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inside a USB-A port with minimal protrusion. This allows for optimized placement in tightly constrained server racks. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">In celebration of this week’s National Cybersecurity Awareness Month theme, <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Internet Wants YOU: Consider a Career in Cybersecurity, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we asked three of our security and open standards rockstars — Jesper Johansson, Torbjörn Granlund, and John Bradley — to share their career background, and the journey that led them to Yubico. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Jesper Johansson, Chief Security Architect, Yubico</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jesper joins Yubico’s Seattle office to grow and lead the Yubico Security Team. He leaves his post at Google, where he worked in the Security &amp; Privacy team. Prior to that, he spent a decade at Amazon, rising to Chief Security Architect for Amazon's Worldwide Consumer business, and was a security strategist and founding team member of the Trustworthy Computing Team at Microsoft.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When asked to impart some advice to those pursuing a career in cybersecurity, he shared:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Two things -- first, learn another field as well. You can't be an expert in security without being an expert in some related field. Security is all about protecting something, and you have to have a good understanding of that something else. Second, be pragmatic. The biggest mistake security folks make is trying to secure things to a level that far exceeds the value of the asset you are protecting, or the risk to that asset. We need to focus on security solutions that support the business rather than those that hinder it.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jesper is the author of three books, many articles, and blog posts, and has delivered more presentations on security than anyone could remember.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Torbjörn Granlund, Senior Software Engineer, Yubico</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Torbjörn recently joined our Stockholm office as an expert in efficient and side channel resilient asymmetric cryptography. He has contributed fundamental functionality to the GNU project, which is used by Linux for file copying, string and memory operations, as well as the GNU compiler.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Torbjörn proves that following your passion and honing your skills can lead to a fulfilling career and significant breakthroughs. “I’ve always been into maths, and in my teens turned into programming. I took a Masters in Science in CS. Far into my career, I realized that my maths skills were lacking, and decided to take a PhD with more maths and more theoretical CS,” said Torbjörn.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Torbjörn developed and authored the <a href="https://gmplib.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GMP arithmetic library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the de facto standard library for arithmetic within the areas of computational number theory — truly a great achievement in the field of mathematics. It is used for asymmetric cryptography in libgcrypt, nettle, GnuTLS, and optionally in OpenSSL. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>John Bradley, Senior Technical Architect, Yubico</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With more than 15 years of experience, John is an Identity Management subject matter expert and IT professional, whose primary focus at Yubico is on open identity standards. <span style="font-weight: 400;">John is treasurer of the openID Foundation and the Open Identity Exchange (OIX), and an active contributor to SAML, OAuth, and other IETF standards. He is also one of the leaders of OSIS and the OpenID Certification, forums that vendors use for industry interoperability testing.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a previous role, John was asked for a solution that offered the same level of security used for the US Government Service Agency (GSA), but was simple enough for the average user. Meeting the challenge, John co-authored the ICAM protocol profiles at Protiviti Government Services on behalf of GSA, and is currently co-authoring the next version of the openID specification and related standards.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The standards are all coming together for 2018, as observed by Microsoft at CIS. We also made progress this year by updating NIST SP-800-63 to a <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">third revision</a> to accommodate the new techniques beyond the original smart card model,” he continued. “The goal is to make possible end-to-end proof of possession security from the first authentication through to the last access token.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With an impressive list of achievements between the three, we are thrilled and proud to welcome them into the Yubico team.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will my YubiKey NEO work on iPhones now that iOS 11 added some NFC support? It’s a fair question – one that we’ve been getting a lot of. This blog explains some of the details about iPhone support for YubiKey OTP to help bring some clarity to YubiKey users.</p>

<p>First, it’s important to understand the limited scope of Apple’s NFC support. Apple’s NFC APIs for iOS (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc#topics">Core NFC</a>) allow iPhone apps to read the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) records from certain NDEF tags (only supported on iPhone 7, 7 Plus, and up). However, there are a few limitations. Besides the fact that the NFC Reader interface can only be fired up from an app, Core NFC does not allow for write operations that are required for authentication protocols like FIDO U2F. That said, NFC on the iOS platform does not support Google’s recently announced Advanced Protection Program.</p>

<p>However, because NFC tag reading is supported, it allows developers to build apps, including consumer facing or purpose-built enterprise applications, with one-time passcode (OTP) support. Given that the YubiKey NEO can generate an OTP and send it to the requesting app via NFC, we finally have some good news for iPhone lovers: <b><i>the YubiKey NEO will support OTP over NFC for applications that run on iOS11 and iPhone versions 7+</i></b>. While Yubico acknowledges this progress, ubiquitous Apple support for strong authentication, namely FIDO protocols, remains out of reach at the moment.</p>

<p>For YubiKey users, this improves OTP two-factor authentication on the iPhone. Now they can authenticate with just a tap of their YubiKey NEO against the phone. Additionally, developers have a better authentication option to integrate with their mobile applications. One caveat remains: developers will have to build NFC support into each individual application to retrieve the OTP from the NDEF tag.<strong><em> Edit (28 May, 2018):</em></strong> See our <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/Software_Projects/Mobile%20iOS%20SDK/1.0.0/">new Mobile SDK for iOS</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast, Android supports NFC natively in the platform. For example, Android developers can open the NDEF record for a URL with the default browser instead of opening up the specific app to read the NDEF tag. Furthermore, Android developers can also add FIDO U2F support using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/fido/android/native-apps">Android FIDO U2F APIs</a>.</p>

<p>While this is encouraging news, we realize it is not yet the complete desired solution. With Apple finally opening up parts of its NFC technology (just like with Touch ID a few years ago), we are hopeful that this standards-based approach will evolve. We know security is only as strong as its weakest link; it is high on our bucket list of things to solve for the ecosystem!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Are your users really who they claim to be? What is the impact to your business if your end-users are registering as fake individuals, or impersonating others? If the identity of your users matters to your business, then you’ll want to join today’s webinar hosted by SC Magazine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Identity, the internet, and your business—architecting your online product/service once was as simple as enabling someone to create a user name and a password. It’s not that easy or simple anymore. User names are easily guessed and passwords are easily breached. The answer, of course, is that identity and access management software need to be absolutely certain that the identity is correct and not an attacker pretending to be the authorized user. NIST 800-63-3 recommends combining identity proofing with multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tune in to today’s webinar on next-gen identity management. Yubico’s foremost Identity expert, John Bradley will chat with SC Media’s Editor, Stephen Lawton about identity proofing in the real world, and how companies can ensure a user’s identity is accurate and not an imposter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, Google formally announced their Advanced Protection Program designed to safeguard the personal Google Accounts of those most at risk of targeted online attacks, including journalists, business leaders, and political campaign teams. Yubico has partnered with Google on this initiative as part of our ongoing commitment to working with people at risk including human rights organizations, such as <a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/reference-customers/freedom-of-the-press-case-study/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Freedom of the Press</a>, EFF, and <a href="https://www.yubico.com/about/reference-customers/isc-project-case-study/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The ISC Project</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/technology/personaltech/tech-security-experts-use.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">journalists at the NY Times</a> and other news publications.</p>

<p>Modern phishing and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks are creating new threats for users and Google’s Advanced protection Program is an important initiative to protect those most at risk. An extensive Google <a href="http://fc16.ifca.ai/preproceedings/25_Lang.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">research study</a>, found that traditional 2-step verification and other authentication methods such as codes sent via SMS, one-time password tokens, and mobile apps are now phishable and susceptible to these attacks. 
</p>

<div style="width: 260px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Security-Key-1.gif" alt="" width="854" height="481" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161741"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Personal Google Account Advanced Protection Program Login Flow</p></div>

<p>This is why Yubico and Google co-created the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard, and why Yubico created the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/2017/10/creating-unphishable-security-key/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unphishable Security Key</a>, supported by Google since 2014. Both the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/fido-u2f-security-key/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FIDO U2F</a> standard and the Security Key form the foundation for Google’s new Advanced Protection Program.</p>

<p>Google’s Advanced Protection Program extends the benefits of using YubiKey security keys with important security enhancements. </p>
<ul style="line-height: 200%; margin-top:20px;">
 	<li><strong>The strongest defense against phishing</strong> - Advanced Protection makes it a requirement to use both a password with a  physical security key when signing in. Other authentication methods that can be more easily phished by attackers, including codes sent via SMS or the Google Authenticator app, are not permitted and will no longer work.</li>
 	<li><strong>Limit data access to trusted apps</strong> - Advanced Protection automatically prevents non Google apps from accessing your most sensitive data, like your emails or documents.</li>
 	<li><strong>Block fraudulent account access</strong> - Advanced Protection adds extra steps to verify your identity during the account recovery process to safeguard against fraudulent account access.</li>
</ul>

<p>In partnership with Google, Yubico is proud and honored to announce our participation and support of those signing up for Google’s Advanced Protection Program.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Infineon Technologies, one of Yubico’s secure element vendors, has informed us of a security issue in their cryptographic firmware library. The issue affects TPMs in millions of computers, and multiple smart card and security token vendors.</p>
<p>For Yubico, the issue weakens the strength of on-chip RSA key generation, and affects some use cases for the PIV smart card and OpenPGP functionality of the YubiKey 4 platform. We&#8217;ve issued a <a href="/support/security-advisories/ysa-2017-01/">security advisory</a> on this issue.</p>
<p>FIDO U2F, OTP, and OATH functions of the YubiKey 4 platform are not affected. The YubiKey NEO, FIDO U2F Security Key and YubiHSM are not impacted, nor are the deprecated products YubiKey Standard and YubiKey Edge. Externally generated RSA keys are not affected.</p>
<p>Yubico estimates that approximately 2% of YubiKey customers utilize the functionality affected by this issue. We have addressed this issue in all shipments of YubiKey 4, YubiKey 4 Nano, and YubiKey 4C, since June 6, 2017.</p>
<p>At this time, we are not aware of any security breaches due to this issue. We are committed to always improving how we protect our customers and continuously invest in making our products even more secure.</p>
<p>We offer customers who are affected mitigation recommendations and optional YubiKey replacement. For more information please refer to our <a href="https://www.yubico.com/keycheck">dedicated customer portal.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new set of mandates aimed to protect the privacy of internet users. From May, 2018, any</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> organization operating, storing or processing data of EU citizens will be subject to the requirements. With the threat of hefty fines of €20M or 4% of worldwide turnover for non-compliance, whichever is greater, GDPR has got everyone’s attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key components for GDPR compliance is the need for strong authentication. With billions of stolen credentials now in circulation, the use of username and passwords is no longer sufficient for protecting personal data. The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security &#8211; </span><a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENISA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211;  describes authentication as ‘key to securing computer systems’ and as the first step ‘in using a remote service or facility, and performing access control’. Referenced as GDPR-compliant authentication solutions are one time password solutions, smart cards, and FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Yubico, it’s been our mission to make strong two factor authentication easy to use and deploy, and available for everyone. We disrupted One Time Password (OTP) technology introducing the simple touch and no client software install solution of the YubiKey. We co-created the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO U2F open standard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and developed a next generation, simplified, and more secure PIV smart card technology. All these protocols and acronyms &#8211; OTP, PIV, FIDO U2F &#8211; enable one YubiKey to provide strong authentication for secure access to the majority of IT systems, ranging from computers and phones to networks and online services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of all the three protocols, FIDO U2F is the most powerful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO U2F has today proven at scale that it is the strongest defense against modern phishing attacks that hijack the session, the so called man-in-the middle attacks. As well as being easy and affordable to use and support, FIDO U2F preserves the privacy of internet citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online authentication and identity technologies store user data and cryptographic secrets in centralized servers. An essential feature of FIDO U2F is that it does not store any means of personally identifiable information (PII), and while it works across any number of services, it does this without sharing any information between the services. And it is these game changing privacy measures that make the YubiKey and FIDO U2F optimal for GDPR compliance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government regulations supporting public safety are not new. Several times before we have seen government step up and re-write laws when the health and security of citizens are at risk. We may like it or not, but some of these laws have been effective. For example, today, significantly fewer people are killed by cars and cigarettes compared to the 1950s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the May 28, 2018 deadline for GDPR rapidly approaching, the days of usernames and passwords as an acceptable authentication technique are numbered. The hefty fines that can be imposed for GDPR non-compliance may be the necessary means for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organizations to become responsible when operating, storing or processing data of EU citizens. Learn more about the security, usability, cost and privacy benefits of </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/solutions/fido-u2f/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FIDO U2F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How the FIDO U2F security key and YubiKey stop phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security is never stronger than its weakest link, and that weakest link is often the user. Not surprisingly, phishing attacks that target users are increasing not only in volume, but also in sophistication. Google knows that. Recently, the search giant updated their login security policy to enable users to set up security keys as their preferred and only authentication method, no longer requiring the use of SMS or a mobile authenticator app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMS and mobile authenticator apps are no longer effective at protecting against the modern man-in-the-middle phishing attacks that are able to hijack the session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent state-of-the-art and old school phishing attacks, Yubico and Google combined a number of advanced security features, listed below, when co-creating the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol, to deliver the unphishable key. </span></p>
<p><b>Origin bound keys</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common phishing attacks is to trick users to visit and log in to a fake website, where the user gives away sensitive login data and performs a fraudulent transaction. With the increasing sophistication of hackers, it is becoming difficult for most users to see the difference between a fake and a real site. Some fake sites may even include the green light indicating a secure connection and an SSL certificate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest sophisticated phishing attacks, so called man-in-the middle, are even more aggressive: hijacking the communication between the user and service, and automatically redirecting the user to the fake web site. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the YubiKey and FIDO U2F Security Key, user login is bound to the origin, meaning that only the real site can authenticate with the key. The authentication will fail on the fake site even if the user was fooled into thinking it was real.</span></p>
<p><b>Verification of user presence</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">By requiring a simple human touch to trigger the key to authenticate, the YubiKey and FIDO U2F Security Key verify that the person logging in is a real live human behind the computer, and not a remote hacker, bot, or trojan. </span></p>
<p><b>No shared secrets </b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">U2F relies on the concept of minting a cryptographic key pair for each service. This means that the authentication secrets for each service are not shared. By using public-key cryptography, the server only has to store the public key for the user. Furthermore, this enhances user privacy as different sites cannot learn for which sites the user has registered.</span></p>
<p><b>Token binding</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Token binding is an additional protection supported by FIDO U2F that secures the connection between the browser and the service to prevent man in the middle attacks. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Token binding allows servers to create cryptographically bound tokens (such as cookies, OAuth tokens) to the TLS layer, to prevent attacks where an attacker exports a bearer token from the user&#8217;s machine to present to a web service and impersonate the user.Token binding is used by FIDO U2F keys to bind the fido authentication token to the user agents TLS connection with the service.</span></p>
<p><b>Native platform/OS support</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey and FIDO U2F Security Key were intentionally designed so that no additional client software is required. With all the authentication software built into the key, this design brings zero friction for the user. Additionally, this eliminates the vulnerability and risk of compromise that comes from any extra client software that needs to be downloaded to a phone or computer.</span></p>
<p><b>Secure backup</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any authentication technology and device can be lost. The affordable hardware-based design of the security key makes it easy for users to setup multiple keys for their accounts. This approach enables secure backups for users at considerably lower support cost compared to using mobile phone authentication technology.  </span></p>
<p><b>Ease of use</b><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last, but not least, the unphishable YubiKey and FIDO U2F Security Key were designed to be easy to use and deploy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these security features work seamlessly. For the user, it is just a simple touch to authenticate. To further simplify, services and users can choose their own policies on how often they need to authenticate with a security key. With the way Facebook has implemented FIDO U2F, users only need to register and authenticate once per trusted laptop or phone.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any online service can easily make support for FIDO U2F using Yubico’s free and open source server code, and integration can be done within a few days. Alternatively, U2F can be implemented via Google and Facebook social login. Through this federation model, millions of websites and billions of users globally have access to online identity protection through unphishable security keys. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, at </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Ignite</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Booth #2063), we proudly announced the first-ever &#8212; and the world’s smallest &#8212; USB-C authentication device of its kind: </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/press-releases/yubico-launches-the-yubikey-4c-nano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the YubiKey 4C Nano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey 4C Nano form factor shares unique features with two of its siblings &#8212; the </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-4-series/#yubikey-4c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey 4C</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-4-series/#yubikey-4-nano" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YubiKey 4 Nano</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Similar to the 4C, the YubiKey 4C Nano is designed for use with the latest USB-C devices, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">such as the newly designed Mac and PC laptops</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Akin to the 4 Nano, the YubiKey 4C Nano’s miniature design and ultra-low profile allows the device to be left in a USB-C port without any disturbance to a user’s work environment or device mobility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the YubiKey 4C Nano’s patent-pending micro-design, the device is built with the same robust, multi-protocol authentication support of the YubiKey 4 product suite. This enables flexible and secure access to a variety of applications: computer login, remote server access, identity access managers, password managers, and an ever-growing number of online web accounts, including Google, Facebook, Dropbox, and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivering enterprise-grade authentication within a micro-sized hardware device is quite frankly an engineering and product design triumph! That said, we talked to Yubico CTO Jakob Ehrensvard for a closer look at some of the behind-the-scenes effort it took to make this happen. Here’s what he had to say:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many users, enterprises, and consumers alike are excited about the YubiKey 4C Nano. How did you know this was the best next step in terms of product development?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Jakob: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YubiKey nano design has become popular for users who want their Yubikey to almost be an integral part of their laptop. Particularly, when the user needs to authenticate often, this setup becomes very convenient. So, immediately after we launched the YubiKey 4C earlier this year, customers began asking us for a nano design. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As discussed, the YubiKey 4C Nano size and design is incredibly impressive. What is some of the unseen work that went into this? </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Jakob:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At first glance, we thought it could not be done. There was simply not enough space to fit both a connector and electronics. The first couple of prototypes simply did not match the elegance of the YubiKey Nano, so we had to go back to the drawing board, and actually design a USB-C connector from the ground up. Fitting the electronics into the small form-factor, and being able to mass-produce them has been a design challenge, but I believe the final result is in keeping with the promise of a YubiKey Nano. It “is just there”, without interfering with everyday use, and without blocking any other ports. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you see this product addition strengthening Yubico’s position to better serve enterprises and consumers? </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Jakob:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With the increasing adoption of USB-C on mobile devices and Apple’s “all in” approach, where they removed all other ports, we believe devices designed specifically for USB-C make the everyday use of the YubiKey simpler and smoother. Going forward, we anticipate a migration to USB-C, where it becomes the ubiquitous standard for peripheral connectivity, from desktop to phones. </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Q:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Moving forward, what will be the next new thing we see from Yubico? </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Jakob:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Broadening the hardware options is one part of the equation. In parallel, we’re working on broadening the protocol and platform support to keep the promise of the YubiKey being the ultimate authentication solution. The upcoming FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards will expand the capabilities and platform support, and we’re excited to be driving this effort. In addition to that, we’re finalizing our second-generation YubiHSM product, which extends the reach of the YubiKey to the backend of the authentication and encryption ecosystem, bringing cryptography for servers to the masses.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Mozilla enabled support for FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) security keys in the pre-beta release of Firefox, </span><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firefox Nightly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Firefox is the second largest internet browser by user base. In the near future, </span><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of the world’s desktop users</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including Chrome and Opera users, will benefit from the open authentication standard and YubiKey support out of the box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When GitHub made support for U2F in 2015, the open source community voted U2F as the most wanted feature in Firefox. We are delighted to now see it happening. Yubico has helped with U2F integration for Firefox and for other platforms and browsers that have or are in the process of making support, as it is critical for taking the YubiKey and U2F unphishable authentication to the global masses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s world, software installation brings with it not only added complexity for the user, but also the potential risk of malware. Chrome has already enabled millions of websites and services to deploy FIDO U2F seamlessly, mainly through Google and Facebook social login, to help mitigate that. Now with native support for FIDO U2F security keys in Firefox, millions more will benefit from strong, hardware-based two-factor authentication without the need to download or install client software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks Mozilla for working on increasing security and usability for internet users!</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, at the 2017 Federal Identity Forum (FedID), we are taking an important step towards a more secure internet for everyone by introducing the first US federal services to offer identity proofing protection with an unphishable FIDO U2F security key.  This solution is enabled through identity proofing provider ID.me, and marks the first roll out of FIDO U2F two-factor authentication for government agencies in the US. We will be demonstrating this integration at the Yubico FedID booth #636.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the co-author of U2F and the leading maker of FIDO U2F security keys, Yubico is thrilled to see ID.me become the first in helping protect US government services using FIDO U2F security keys. Today, US citizens can use the same YubiKey to log in securely to leading internet services, including Google and Facebook, and now on federal sites where ID.me is used for identity proofing.  This is a great milestone for all the contributors of the FIDO U2F standards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thieves can guess or steal passwords from a database, and they can spoof biometrics,” said Blake Hall, CEO of ID.me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A physical FIDO U2F security key is ‘unphishable’ – to provide more robust and easy to use security to all customers, it’s essential to support FIDO U2F based standards and the adoption of security keys.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s announcement of US e-Government support for FIDO U2F follows last year&#8217;s launch by the UK government. Similar to the US government  initiatives, the GOV.UK Verify service for UK citizens offers a combination of identity proofing, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">single-sign on, and secure authentication </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with FIDO U2F security keys.  GOV.UK Verify used with FIDO U2F was enabled through identity provider Digidentity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico is in dialogue with many other countries around the world that are considering offering U2F authentication for citizen-facing government services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico and ID.me will discuss the new capabilities at FedID during their</span><a href="http://events.afcea.org/GlobalID17/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&amp;SessionID=6189&amp;nav=true&amp;Role=U%27"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Unphishable” Authentication by the VA Panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> session on Thursday, September 14th , 2017, at 2:15pm-3:15pm.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yubico is proud to announce that our CEO and Founder, Stina Ehrensvard, won in the Thought Leaders category of the inaugural <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/thought-leaders--stina-ehrensvard/article/682591/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SC Media Reboot Leadership Awards</a>. Honorees across a range of professional categories were revealed in today’s special editorial section at <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/thought-leaders--stina-ehrensvard/article/682591/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCMagazine.com</a>, and recognized for their outstanding service, qualifications, and advancements in cybersecurity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Businesses today are increasingly under threat by a range of cybercriminals,” said Teri Robinson, Executive Editor, SC Media. “The cybersecurity leaders we’re celebrating with these leadership awards are on the frontlines every day to help defend and protect our critical systems, data, and privacy from their attacks. To showcase their advances is SC’s honor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awards program is designed to showcase and acknowledge industry luminaries who positively impact the cybersecurity arena. As an extension of SC Media’s annual Reboot edition, the announcement will also be published in print at the end of the year, when the editorial team identifies the best and brightest cybersecurity professionals and their many achievements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Winning the SC Media Reboot Leadership Award, in its very first year, is truly an honor and one that represents our company as a whole,” said Ehrensvard. “Our core product, the YubiKey, has become the gold-standard for easy-to-use authentication and encryption. In close collaboration with our customers and top internet companies, we will continue to drive innovation, enabling a safer internet for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contenders in various categories faced a thorough judging process conducted by SC Media’s editorial team. The process included a review of their professional background, references, efforts to benefit the wider industry, and any other research deemed necessary by editorial leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stina Ehrensvard exemplifies leadership in one of the most vibrant and fast-evolving industries today,” continued Robinson. “That’s what this awards program is all about – highlighting some of the strongest leaders of the cybersecurity arena whose efforts more often than not underpin every business and leisure activity we all undertake online nowadays. The advances made in this marketplace to protect data, privacy and people are vital to all that we do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this inaugural year, the SC Media Reboot Leadership Awards program will continue to be an annual celebration of the notable contributions, thought leadership, and unique improvements made by a wide range of IT and information security players.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, information security enthusiasts and experts across the country will make their way to Las Vegas, NV to attend the annual <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Hat</a> cybersecurity conference. Find us during the expo (July 26 &#8211; 27) at Booth #572, where we will double down on our award-winning YubiKeys, demonstrate the simplicity of hardware-backed authentication, and speak on the advantages of physical, one-touch YubiKey authentication over other authentication methods, such as push or SMS.</p>
<p>Simplicity and flexibility are not often associated with strong authentication. That is not the case here at Yubico. We believe in making easy-to-use yet exceptional internet security accessible to everyone, and our YubiKeys deliver on that promise. With built-in support for <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/compare-yubikeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple authentication protocols</a>, a single YubiKey can secure an unlimited number of applications with just one touch. No shared secrets, drivers, or client software needed &#8212; it’s not part of a Vegas magic show, we swear!</p>
<p>Black Hat attendees can experience innovative authentication in action at the Yubico booth. We will demonstrate the ease, speed, and flexibility of multi-protocol YubiKeys in different scenarios &#8212; from U2F authentication across cloud platforms like Google and Dropbox, to leading IAM integrations, to smart card (PIV) authentication for computer login.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Jerrod Chong, VP of Solutions, will take the stage to deliver his presentation, “Think All MFA is the Same? Think Again.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 100%;"><em>Wednesday, July 26 | 12:30pm &#8211; 1:20pm</em><br />
<strong><em>Think All MFA is the Same? Think Again</em></strong><br />
<em>Location: Oceanside F, Level 2</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; font-size: 100%;"><em>Authentication&#8217;s evolution is unfolding as newer protocols and multi-function hardware-backed keys offer fortified security compared to today&#8217;s weak and vulnerable credentials. These enhanced capabilities are designed to defend enterprises and individuals against advanced phishing techniques, and protect privacy by delivering public key crypto in the form of FIDO&#8217;s Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol and next-gen smart card functionalities. Jerrod Chong, Yubico&#8217;s VP of Solutions, will discuss the advantages of hardware-backed keys using several MFA capabilities on a single device to address today&#8217;s advanced credential thefts.</em></p>
<p>If you are attending Black Hat, we’d love to meet you. Stop by Booth #572 and grab a seat during Jerrod’s presentation!
